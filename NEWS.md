# openalexPro (dev)

## New Features

* Exported `infer_json_schema()` for direct use. Infers a unified DuckDB columns
  clause from a set of JSON/NDJSON files via per-file `DESCRIBE` queries with
  type-widening and optional two-level disk caching (`schema_cache_dir`).

## Bug Fixes

* Fixed Windows path-normalization failures in `snapshot_to_parquet()`,
  `build_corpus_index()`, `lookup_by_id()`, and `pro_request_jsonl_parquet()`.
  On Windows, `normalizePath()` can return 8.3 short names (e.g. `RUNNER~1`)
  for `tempdir()`-derived paths while `list.files()` and DuckDB resolve to long
  names (`runneradmin`). Resume detection in `snapshot_to_parquet()` used
  `%in%` on paths with mixed separators (`\` vs `/`), causing already-converted
  files to be reconverted. `build_corpus_index()` embedded `snapshot_dir` (with
  `\`) inside a DuckDB `regexp_replace` pattern, which never matched — so the
  full absolute path was stored in the index and later doubled by
  `lookup_by_id()`. `pro_request_jsonl_parquet()` used `normalizePath` string
  comparison to detect subdirectories, which always failed, placing every output
  file in a spurious `query=<dirname>` subdirectory.

  Fixes: (1) normalize separators to `/` with `gsub("\\\\", "/", ...)` on both
  sides of `%in%` comparisons; (2) compute relative paths in R using path-depth
  counting (`strsplit(path, "/")` then indexed extraction) rather than
  string-matching absolute paths — immune to 8.3 vs long-name differences;
  (3) pass the relative path as a SQL literal in `build_corpus_index()` instead
  of computing it inside DuckDB with a regex.

## Changes

* Schema cache per-file CSVs renamed from `%06d_<basename>.schema.csv` to
  `<update_date>_<part_name>.csv` (e.g. `2024-01-15_part_001.csv`), making
  each cache file directly traceable to its source `.gz`.

## Breaking Changes

* Removed `mailto` parameter from all API functions (`pro_request()`, `pro_fetch()`,
  `pro_count()`, `pro_validate_credentials()`). OpenAlex no longer uses email addresses
  for polite-pool access.
* `api_key` is now required. All API functions (`pro_request()`, `pro_fetch()`,
  `pro_count()`) will error with a clear message if `openalexPro.apikey` is not set.
  Set it via `Sys.setenv(openalexPro.apikey = "your-key")` or in `.Renviron`.
* Simplified User-Agent string from `openalexPro v[VERSION] (mailto:[EMAIL])` to
  `openalexPro/[VERSION]`.

# openalexPro 0.5.0

## New Features

### Snapshot Handling
* Added `prepare_snapshot()` function for setting up a directory with Makefile and documentation
  for managing OpenAlex snapshots.
* Added `Makefile.snapshot` in `inst/` for automating snapshot download, conversion, and indexing.
  Includes targets for `snapshot`, `parquet`, `parquet_index`, and automatic renaming of existing
  data with release dates.
* Added `snapshot_to_parquet()` function for converting OpenAlex snapshot NDJSON files to Parquet format
  using DuckDB. Processes each `.gz` file individually with per-file resume support. Supports parallel
  processing via `workers` (using `future_lapply()`) and unified schema inference via `sample_size`.
* Added `build_corpus_index()` function for creating memory-efficient Parquet indexes for fast ID lookups.
  Handles 300M+ records by processing parquet files individually, with optional parallelization via
  `workers` and progress reporting via `progressr`. The index file is auto-named and placed alongside
  the corpus directory.
* Added `lookup_by_id()` function for fast record retrieval from a parquet corpus using pre-built indexes.
  Uses Arrow for index filtering with automatic ID normalization. Supports parallel reads
  via `workers` and streaming to parquet via `output` for millions of IDs without loading into memory.
* Added `snapshot_filter_ids()` function for filtering snapshot data by ID lists.
* Added `id_block()` helper function for computing ID block partitions.

## Documentation

* Added `snapshot.qmd` vignette with comprehensive guide on downloading, converting, and querying
  OpenAlex snapshots locally.

## Changes

* Refactored `snapshot_to_parquet()` to process each `.gz` file individually instead of all at once.
  This reduces memory usage, enables per-file resume on interruption, and shows progress with ETA.
  The `workers` parameter now controls parallel `future` workers instead of DuckDB threads.
  Added `sample_size` parameter for schema inference.
* Extracted `infer_json_schema()` and `convert_json_to_parquet()` internal helpers, shared by
  both `snapshot_to_parquet()` and `pro_request_jsonl_parquet()`.
* Refactored `pro_request_jsonl_parquet()` to per-file conversion with `future_lapply()`
  parallelization. Removes hive partitioning by `page`; subfolder structure is preserved
  directly. Added `workers` parameter. Removed `progress` parameter (replaced by `progressr`).

## Bug Fixes

* Fixed vignette parse errors in `pro_query.qmd` (malformed code block closings).
* Fixed out-of-memory crash in `snapshot_to_parquet()` when `sample_size` exceeded the
  number of available files (e.g. `sample_size = 10000` with 1981 works files). Schema
  inference now processes one file at a time instead of a single bulk DuckDB query.
* Fixed `duplicate key "as"` crash when converting the `works` dataset.
  `abstract_inverted_index` is now stored as `VARCHAR` (raw JSON string) rather than a
  `STRUCT`. DuckDB folds struct field names to lowercase, causing a collision between the
  valid JSON keys `"as"` and `"As"` in this field. Storing as `VARCHAR` avoids struct
  parsing entirely and preserves the data. Parse individual values with
  `jsonlite::fromJSON()` when needed.
* Fixed DuckDB temp file IO errors during `snapshot_to_parquet()` by exposing a
  `TEMP_DIR` variable in `Makefile.snapshot` (default `/tmp`).

## Changes

* `snapshot_to_parquet()` schema inference now runs one DuckDB `DESCRIBE` per file
  instead of a single query across all sampled files. Results are cached in
  `<parquet_ds>/.schema_cache/`: per-file CSVs (`<update_date>_<part_name>.csv`) enable
  mid-run resume; a unified `unified_schema.csv` is loaded on subsequent runs to skip
  inference entirely. Delete `unified_schema.csv` to force re-inference.

## Tests

* Added comprehensive tests for `snapshot_to_parquet()`, `build_corpus_index()`, and `lookup_by_id()`.
* Added tests for schema caching, unified schema reuse, and works `abstract_inverted_index` VARCHAR round-trip.

# openalexPro v0.4.2

## Breaking Changes

* removal of `load_sql_file()` function as not needed anymore

## Documentation

* Update from vignettes and adding of new ones
* Update of README.md

## Tests

* Remove need in tests for openalexR

# openalexPro 0.4.1

* Standardised progressbar handling
* Changed default pages from 1,000 to 10,000
* Refactored `pro_query` and removed `multiple_ids` argument using Claude and expanded tests and added vignette.
* Added creation of `00_completed` in output directory of `json`, `jsonl` and `parquet` folders upon successful completion
* Changed api key and email handling. Removed oap_mail()_ and oap_apikey() and simplified handling of api key and email to only use
  environmental variables `openalexPro.email` and `openalexPro.apikey`
* Added unified schema inference to `pro_request_jsonl_parquet()` to prevent schema conflicts when reading
  combined Parquet datasets. New `sample_size` parameter controls schema inference sampling. This fixes
  "Unsupported cast from string to struct" errors when fields have different types across JSONL files
  (e.g., `apc_paid` being `null` in some files and a struct in others).
* Removed `harmonize_parquet_schemata()` as it is no longer needed with the new unified schema inference.
* Increased default n umber of pages to be read by `request_json()` from 1000 to 10000 to allow the initially planned 2,000,000
  work download.
