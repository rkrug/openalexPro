# Introduction

This package is inspired by the package [`openalexR`](https://github.com/ropensci/openalexR) but provides a different approach to retrieve works from OpenAlex. In contrast to `openalexR`, which does all processing and conversions in memory, [`openalexPro`](https://openalexpro.r-universe.dev/openalexPro) uses an on-disc processing approach where the data is processed by number of records returned per individual call, i.e. a per-page processing approach. Doing all processing in memory has advantages for smaller numbers of records retrieved from [OpenAlex](https://openalex.org), but limits the number of works which can be retrieved due to memory limitations and a considerable slowdown due to repeated memory allocations even before that. The on-disc based processing essentially should scale at most linearly with the number of pages requested from [OpenAlex](https://openalex.org) and likely considerably less as parallel processing is used extensively in [`openalexPro`](https://openalexpro.r-universe.dev/openalexPro).

# Quickstart

## Installation

The latest "stable" version is available via [r-universe](https://openalexpro.r-universe.dev/openalexPro)

```r
install.packages('openalexPro', repos = c('https://openalexpro.r-universe.dev', 'https://cloud.r-project.org'))
```

The "development" version can be installed from github.
**This is generally not recommended!**
Unless you need bleeding edge functionality and can deal with changing function definitions, or want to test new functionality, this is not recommended.

```r
remotes::install_github("openalexPro/openalexPro", ref = "dev")
```

## Authentication (Optional, Recommended)

`openalexPro` can run without an API key, but OpenAlex applies much stricter
limits in unauthenticated mode. For real workloads, an API key should be obtained. 
Let's assume your key is "xxxxxxx".

There are three ways of providing, which are evaluated in order:

1. You can set an `openalexPro` option using `opt_api_key("xxxxxxx")
2. You can set the environmental variable `openalexPro.api_key` to the API key. This can be set in 
   the `.Renviron file` 
3. You can save your API key in the keyring using `keyring::key_set("API_openalex")` which will ask you 
   for the key which then will be saved securely and encrypted in your keyring. Where that is, 
   depends on the OS and your setup (see the [`keyring` package documentation](https://keyring.r-lib.org/index.html) for details).
  
The safest one is (3), but (1) depends how you put the API key in the option.

After setup, you can validate your credentials and see your available daily or prepaid budget:

```r
# Check current key status
pro_validate_credentials()

# Inspect budget/usage (requires a valid key)
pro_rate_limit_status()
```

## Live API Contract Tests (Optional)

The default test suite is cassette-based and deterministic.  
To run online contract checks against the live OpenAlex API:

```r
Sys.setenv(OPENALEXPRO_LIVE_TESTS = "true")
devtools::test(filter = "900-live")
```

### 1. Define query (`openalexPro::pro_query()`)

The query is defined using the function `openalexPro::pro_query()`. It follows the logic and arguments of `openalexR::oa_query()`. In addition to `openalexR::oa_query()`, the names of filters as well as fields selected for retrieval are verified before sending them to OpenAlex. 

The supported filter names can be retrieved by running

```r
opt_filter_names()
```

and supported select fields by running

```r
opt_select_fields()
```

This defines a basic query.

```r
query <- pro_query(
entity = "works",
  search = "biodiversity sandwich island",
  from_publication_date = "2023-01-01",
  type = "article",
  select = c("ids", "title", "publication_year", "cited_by_count")
)
```

This returns a URL, which one can open in the browser.

If, however, for example 100 DOIs are given to be retrieved, the query is chunked into chunks of a maximum of the value of the argument `chunk_limit`, default is 50. In this case, the functions returns a `list()` with each element named `Chunk_x` and containing the URL as a character vector.

The resulting URL(s) can be opened in the browser for evaluation.

## `pro_fetch()`

For most use cases, `pro_fetch()` handles everything in one call:

```r
# Download, transform, and convert to Parquet in one step
pro_fetch(
  query_url = url,
  project_folder = "Biodiversity_from_sandwich_islands",
  progress = TRUE
)
```

All intermediate folders and data are deleted, and only the final parquet dataset remains in `Biodiversity_from_sandwich_islands/parquet/`.

## Advanced Workflow (Individual Functions)

For more control over the pipeline, use the individual functions:

```r
library(openalexPro)
```


### 1. Retrieving records (`openalexPro::pro_request()`)

```r
json_files <- openalexPro::pro_request(
  query_url = query,
  output = "json",
  verbose = TRUE
)
```

Will retrieve the records and save them into the folder specified in output. One important difference is now between the query being a single URL or a list: if it is a list, the `future` and `future.apply` packages are used to process the URLs in the list in parallel.

`pro_request()` also accepts **nested lists**, which creates a mirrored nested directory structure. The subsequent `pro_request_jsonl_parquet()` step converts the directory depth into hive-style partition keys (`query=<name>`, `query_l2=<name>`, …), so the final parquet dataset can be filtered by group directly:

```r
queries <- list(
  year_2022 = pro_query(entity = "works", publication_year = 2022),
  year_2023 = pro_query(entity = "works", publication_year = 2023)
)
pro_fetch(query_url = queries, project_folder = "by_year")

# Parquet partitions: by_year/parquet/query=year_2022/ and query=year_2023/
arrow::open_dataset("by_year/parquet") |> dplyr::filter(query == "year_2022")
```

### 3. Processing `json` files (`openalexPro::pro_request_jsonl()`)

This step prepares the json files for the final ingestion into a `parquet` database:

```r
openalex_jsonl_folder <- openalexPro::pro_request_jsonl(
  input_json = json_files,
  output = "jsonl_files",
  verbose = TRUE
)
```

The resulting json files can be found in the folder as specified in `output`.

### 4. Convert to `parquet` database (`openalexPro::pro_request_jsonl_parquet()`)

Here the files are converted into a parquet page partitioned dataset saved as individual `parquet` files in the folder provided by the `output` argument.

```r
parquet <- "./parquet"
openalexPro::pro_request_jsonl_parquet(
  input_jsonl = jsonl_files,
  output = parquet,
  verbose = TRUE
)
```

These functions are pipeline ready and can be chained in a pipeline:

```r
corpus <- pro_query(...) |>
  pro_request(...) |>
  pro_request_jsonl(...) |>
  pro_request_jsonl_parquet(...)
```

### Convenience Function to Read the Retrieved Data (`openalexPro::read_corpus()`)
The `read_corpus()` function reads the corpus either as a arrow `Dataset` object if `return_data = FALSE`, which is essentially metadata to the dataset,  or a `data.frame`, if `return_data = TRUE`, in which case the whole dataset is loaded into memory.
Especially the `return_data = FALSE` opens possiblilities on on-disc process =ing of mlarge datasets using the `dplyr` pipeline with `dplyr::collect()` at the end to retrieve the actual data:

```r
read_corpus("Biodiversity_from_sandwich_islands") |>
  dplyr::filter(cited_by_count > 100) |>

  # only now, the actual data is retrieved.
  dplyr::collect()
```

# Design Principles
The retrieval of works and the initial processing / preparation can be split into these three steps:

In a first step (`openalexPro::pro_request()`), each page from the API call is saved into an individual json file as returned by the API. The number of retrieved records is effectively only limited by the space on the drive where the json files are saved. As the complete responses including metadata are saved, one could end here and use custom made code to further process the responses, i.e. ingest it into a database. 

In a second step (`openalexPro::pro_request_jsonl()`), the json files are processed on a per file basis using the `jq` command-line json processor. In this step the abstract text is re-constructed, a citation string for each work is generated, and optionally add a `page` field is added. It writes the resulting json file as a newline-delimited JSON (.jsonl), suitable for further processing using `arrow` or DuckDB.

In the third (and final) step (`openalexPro::pro_request_jsonl_parquet()`) converts the jsonl files into a parquet database partitioned by `page` using the `duckdb` package. Again, as the processing is done per page as well, the conversion is not limited by memory.

This approach results in a stable pipeline which works for the retrieval of small as well as large to huge corpora. As the processing is done per page (which have a maximum of 200 works), the scaling should be more or less linear (in one application, more than 4 million works were retrieved without problems). 

One point which needs to be taken into consideration when retrieving huge corpora, are rate limits by OpenAlex (see [here](https://docs.openalex.org/how-to-use-the-api/rate-limits-and-authentication) and [here](https://help.openalex.org/hc/en-us/articles/24397762024087-Pricing) for further details). Use `pro_rate_limit_status()` to inspect your current daily budget, usage, and remaining allowance at any time.

The final format which is used in this package to save the retrieved data is the `parquet` format which is space efficient and allows on disc processing, therefore there is no need to load the complete data into memory (see [here](https://parquet.apache.org/docs/) for a detailed description of the format as well as the [r-package `arrow`](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/r/)). To use the on disc processing in R, the `arrow` packages interfaces directly with `dplyr`, so that one can do a lot of processing before retrieving the actual data into memory (see the section on [dplyr and arrow](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/arrow.html#using-dplyr-with-arrow) as well more general the [arrow chapter](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/arrow.html) in Hadley Wickham's [R for Data Science (2e)](https://r4ds.hadley.nz) book).

# Snowball Searches

Snowball search functionality has moved to the separate
[`openalexSnowball`](https://github.com/openalexPro/openalexSnowball) package, which
depends on `openalexPro` for the underlying pipeline.
