## Overview

The OpenAlex API is a free, open, and modern RESTful API providing access to a vast catalog of scholarly works, authors, institutions, and more. Understanding the HTTP status codes it returns is crucial for effective error handling and optimizing your API usage.

## Successful Responses

### 200 OK

Indicates that the request was successful, and the response contains the requested data.

## Client Errors

### 400 Bad Request

The server could not understand the request due to invalid syntax. This may occur if the request includes illegal characters or malformed parameters.

### 403 Forbidden

The server understood the request but refuses to authorize it. This can happen when using illegal IDs, such as those containing commas or ampersands.

### 404 Not Found

The requested resource does not exist. For example, querying a non-existent work ID will result in this status.

### 429 Too Many Requests

The user has sent too many requests in a given amount of time. OpenAlex imposes limits of 100,000 API calls per day and 10 requests per second. Exceeding these limits will trigger this status.

## Server Errors

### 500 Internal Server Error

The server encountered an unexpected condition that prevented it from fulfilling the request.

### 503 Service Unavailable

The server is currently unable to handle the request due to temporary overloading or maintenance.

*Note: While 500 and 503 errors are standard HTTP status codes, they are not specifically documented for the OpenAlex API but may occur under certain conditions.*

## Joining the Polite Pool

OpenAlex categorizes API users into two pools:

- **Polite Pool**: Users who identify themselves by providing a contact email. This pool offers more consistent and faster response times.
- **Common Pool**: Users who do not provide identification.

To join the polite pool, include your email address in one of the following ways:

### 1. As a Query Parameter

Append the `mailto` parameter to your API requests:
