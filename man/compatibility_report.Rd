\description{
Renders the Quarto report at `system.file("compatibility.qmd", package = "openalexPro")
and opens the resulting HTML in your default browser.
}
\details{
This report is designed to help you validate clientâ€“API compatibility in
real time. During rendering, the report performs live requests against the
OpenAlex API and compares the responses to the package's expected behavior.
No cached data are used: every section issues fresh API calls so that the
output reflects the current state of the upstream service. The report
summarizes differences in fields, types, pagination and response shapes to
surface potential regressions from upstream changes or local client updates.

Note: Because it depends on live API calls, rendering may take longer and
requires network access. Be mindful of API rate limits when running the
report repeatedly.
