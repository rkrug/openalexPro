the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity has been called one of the greatest challenges. At the heart of this challenge lies the low financial and political value which is often assigned to biodiversity and the resulting lack of financial mechanisms for conservation and sustainable use. This report provides an overview of existing and experimental financing mechanisms that can be used to encourage the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity. To help to better understand these mechanisms, it proposes a taxonomy that divides the mechanisms into three categories: 1) Those that protect biodiversity as a public good; 2) Those that require correcting so-called \"negative externalities\" that hamper biodiversity conservation; 3) Those that can be used to support biodiversity-based businesses. The report ends with recommendations on how the Bank can support financing mechanisms that promote the conservation of biodiversity and its sustainable use.","citation":"Ricardo Bayón et al.

1992 Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) challenged signatory countries to seek and encourage new financial resources, including private-sector resources, to implement the objectives of the Convention. During the past decade, pioneering businesses have succeeded at making money while conserving and sustainably using biodiversity. What lessons have we learned? How can we speed up the adoption of biodiversity-friendly business activities? Where and how can additional private investment for biodiversity conservation and sustainable use be found? To answer these questions, this article reviews why biodiversity conservation needs private-sector finance. It defines the beneficial links between business and biodiversity; presents the business rationale for financing conservation and sustainable use; identifies who is currently investing in these businesses; and outlines the conditions necessary to attract considerably more amounts of private-sector financing for biodiversity conservation and sustainable use.","citation":"Michael C.

Payments for environmental services (PES) are a promising mechanism for conservation. PES could either provide additional funding for protected areas, pay land users to conserve biodiversity outside protected areas, or both. PES require a secure long-term source of financing to work effectively. Obtaining payments directly for biodiversity conservation is difficult, however. In most cases, water users are the most likely source, either directly or indirectly. Thus the potential for PES to help conserve biodiversity depends, in a large measure, on the degree to which areas of interest for conservation of water services overlap with areas of interest for conservation of biodiversity. This paper examines the extent of such an overlap in the case of highland Guatemala. The results show that this potential varies substantially within the country, with some biodiversity conservation priority areas having very good potential for receiving payments, and others little or none. Overall, about a quarter of all biodiversity conservation priority areas have potential for receiving payments. Thus PES are far from being a silver bullet for biodiversity conservation, but they can make a meaningful contribution to this objective.","citation":"Stefano Pagiola et al. (2010)","page":1}

recent years, organizations such as Conservation International (CI) have been actively engaged in creative financial engineering techniques to raise funds for biodiversity programs throughout the world. The opportunities afforded by programs to restructure sovereign debt owed to private commercial banks, along with public debt restructuring programs supported by inter-governmental debt reduction initiatives have increased the momentum and sophistication of these creative financial techniques. The latest innovation in finance has been the creation of offshore dollar-funded trusts to endow national parks. At the urging of U.S.-based and other non-profit organizations, the recently established Global Environmental Facility (GEF), and certain bilateral donors, have begun to experiment with using trust funds as a tool to provide for long term biodiversity conservation.I. Debt for Nature Swaps Involving Commercial Bank DebtOne popular technique is the Debt for Nature Swap. The concept of this transaction is as follows: A group such as CI wants to mobilize funding for large-scale and long-term efforts around sites of unique and remarkable biodiversity in countries throughout the world. The organization purchases debt owed to a private commercial bank by a subject country's government at a discount from face value. In many cases this debt is held by the commercial bank in its trading portfolio. A lot of this debt has been securitized in recent years into a bond rather than a loan, carrying a coupon rate of interest and with a fixed redemption date and amount. This occurred in the 1980's under the terms of the Brady Plan for restructuring of LDC debt.The banks buy and sell these bonds among themselves or carry it in their inventory. Because the country whose debt has been securitized may not have a good track record paying its international debt obligations, the bonds may trade at a major discount to face value. In turn, this enables the organization to purchase the bonds at a discount from the commercial bank or broker selling them. Depending on the country involved, the discount can be substantial.The purchasing organization then legally cancels the debt obligation owed by the host country government, in return for that government issuing local currency or securities domestically within the host country at a greater equivalent value than the discounted value at which the bonds were originally purchased. This local currency, or in the case of the bonds, the income therefrom, is used to fund the operations of the organization in that country. In some (but not all) cases, the value of the local currency or bonds issued will be equal to the full par value of the bonds purchased by the organization from the commercial bank. The difference between the discounted price paid on the secondary market and the higher amount redeemed in local currency is the conservation premium awarded by the country in benefit of the program approved.For example, CI may wish to fund programs in Mexico. It purchases Mexican Brady Bonds (Discount Bonds) from Citibank in New York, paying $US 750,000 for $1 million of debt (i.e. supposing the debt trades at about a 25% discount from face value). Under a pre-negotiated debt conversion accord, CI then goes to the Ministry of Finance in Mexico and cancels the debt in exchange for the issue of the equivalent of $US 1 million worth of Mexican pesos to CI's affiliate in Mexico, to fund biodiversity projects jointly developed and approved by Government and local non-governmental organizations there.All parties benefit from the transaction. Citibank, the seller of the bonds, disposes of debt it no longer wishes to carry on its books, and earns fees and commissions through its trading activities. CI benefits because it has available $1 million worth of local currency to fund biodiversity programs for which it has raised $750,000 (in effect a conservation match of $250,000). …","citation":"Steven M.

latest update of their aggregate governance indicators, together with new analysis of several issues related to the use of these measures. The governance indicators measure the following six dimensions of governance: (1) voice and accountability; (2) political instability and violence; (3) government effectiveness; (4) regulatory quality; (5) rule of law, and (6) control of corruption. They cover 209 countries and territories for 1996, 1998, 2000, 2002, and 2004. They are based on several hundred individual variables measuring perceptions of governance, drawn from 37 separate data sources constructed by 31 organizations. The authors present estimates of the six dimensions of governance for each period, as well as margins of error capturing the range of likely values for each country. These margins of error are not unique to perceptions-based measures of governance, but are an important feature of all efforts to measure governance, including objective indicators. In fact, the authors give examples of how individual objective measures provide an incomplete picture of even the quite particular dimensions of governance that they are intended to measure. The authors also analyze in detail changes over time in their estimates of governance; provide a framework for assessing the statistical significance of changes in governance; and suggest a simple rule of thumb for identifying statistically significant changes in country governance over time. The ability to identify significant changes in governance over time is much higher for aggregate indicators than for any individual indicator. While the authors find that the quality of governance in a number of countries has changed significantly (in both directions), they also provide evidence suggesting that there are no trends, for better or worse, in global averages of governance. Finally, they interpret the strong observed correlation between income and governance, and argue against recent efforts to apply a discount to governance performance in low-income countries.

uman impacts on the environment are intensifying, raising vexing questions of how best to allocate the limited resources available for biodiversity conservation. Which creatures and places most deserve attention? Which should we ignore, potentially accepting their extinction? The answer to this dilemma depends on one's objectives. To motivate action, conservationists often mix diverse ethical and practical objectives, hoping they will reinforce each other. But attention given to one goal may instead diminish the prospects for achieving others.\n\nTo examine whether different objectives for conservation conflict with or reinforce each other, consider the two principal approaches that seem to differ most fundamentally in objective. Caricaturing slightly, the first is focused on biodiversity conservation for its own sake, independent of human needs or desires. The second is focused on safeguarding ecosystem services for humanity's sake: for the provision of goods, basic life-support services, and human enjoyment of nature.\n\nWe worry about the imbalance in attention devoted to these approaches: Most conservation research and funding are oriented toward biodiversity with, until recently, little tangible effort being directed toward ecosystem services. Although the latter are often used as a justification for the former, little is known about the circumstances under which the two approaches actually contribute to each other. Certainly the relative merit of alternative conservation goals is as much a matter of social choice as of scientific debate. Yet a well-integrated scientific framework for weighing their merits is key to decision-making, especially when these goals may be at odds.\n\nA wide range of priorities, and criteria for defining them, has been proposed for biodiversity conservation. By contrast, neither general priorities nor a methodology for establishing them have been systematically developed for safeguarding ecosystem services. Mapping the distribution of biodiversity and threats to it is a key tool for turning priorities into plans of action. Analogous maps of ecosystem services priorities, which would locate suppliers, consumers, and threats relevant to each service, are virtually nonexistent. Such a mapping process could illuminate several key things: (i) the levels and types of services supplied by alternative land management regimes; (ii) the degree of spatial congruence in the supply of different services; and (iii) forecasted changes both in services and in the societal need for them, under alternative future scenarios of demographic, land use, and climatic change.\n\nHow much are these two approaches likely to coincide? The degree of concordance will depend on complex, and at present little-understood, interactions between biodiversity and resultant ecosystem services. Many ecosystem services may be unaffected by small losses of biodiversity, but they may deteriorate rapidly when, for instance, most of the elements of a functional group are gone. The coincidence of the two strategies is likely to increase as (i) an increasing number of services is considered; (ii) functional redundancy is valued as a buffer against random natural events (such as drought) and ongoing anthropogenic change; and (iii) the relative weight placed on biodiversity-intensive services, such as aesthetic and option values, increases.\n\nFor any ecosystem service, however, the devil will be in the details. For instance, the relation between pollinator diversity and crop pollination in an area will depend on factors such as the efficiency of each pollinator species across crops, the dynamics of pollinator populations, and competition for pollinators between crops and noncrop plants. The relationship between biodiversity and productivity is similarly complex.\n\nYet policymakers require practical, defensible recommendations now. What can scientists offer? The Millennium Ecosystem Assessment aims to provide the first global appraisal of the condition and future prospects of ecosystems, and to build local and global capacity for evaluating the complex tradeoffs involved in managing ecosystems for either biodiversity conservation or safeguarding ecosystem services. Also promising is the development of creative conservation financing mechanisms that are aimed at both, such as the U.S. Nature Conservancy's Center for Innovative Conservation Finance.\n\nAbove all, we must remember that biodiversity is in serious jeopardy for a reason: namely, that the opportunity costs of conservation are perceived to be too high. The best hope for biodiversity is to create and align diverse incentives for conservation wherever possible and to integrate these into the larger policy-making arena.","citation":"Patricia Balvanera et al.

major challenge in tropical land management is to meet the ever-growing demand for agricultural products while conserving biodiversity, providing critical ecosystem services, and maintaining rural livelihoods. This challenge is particularly acute in the Mesoamerican biodiversity hotspot, a region of high conservation value for both wild and domesticated species that is undergoing rapid human population growth, ecological degradation, and loss of traditional farming systems (Myers et al. 2000; Harvey et al. 2005a). Approximately 80% of the region's vegetation has been converted to agriculture, threatening biodiversity. More than 300 of the region's endemic species of flora and fauna are threatened, including at least 107 that are critically endangered (CI 2007). With continuing habitat loss (deforestation is 1.2%/year in Central America and Mexico combined; FAO 2005) and fragmentation of remaining forests, pressure on the region's biodiversity will intensify. Habitat destruction and fragmentation are not the only drivers of biodiversity loss in the region, however. Globalization of market forces, agricultural industrialization, migration, public policy, and cultural changes are driving the transformation of diverse, traditional, smallholder agroecosystems into agroindustrial systems dependent on chemical inputs and mechanization (Conway & Rosset 1996; Perfecto et al. 1996; Angelsen & Kaimowitz 2001). Agroindustrial intensification is often accompanied by significant reductions in tree cover, fallow vegetation, habitat diversity, and forest connectivity. These transformations directly threaten species dependent on natural habitat and undermine indigenous management practices that coevolved with this biodiversity for over 10,000 years (Nigh & Levy Tacher 2008). Despite considerable efforts to protect biodiversity in reserves and parks in Mesoamerica, many of these refuges are small, fragmented, isolated, or poorly protected (Miller et al. 2001), and not all ecosystems or species are represented adequately (Powell et al. 2000; Rodrigues et al. 2004). Besides having inadequate dimensions, most protected areas are embedded within an agricultural landscape, and existing buffer zones are inadequate to alleviate effects of fragmentation, contamination by agrochemicals, hunting, and unsustainable or illegal logging (DeFries et al. 2005). The fate of biodiversity within protected areas is therefore inextricably linked to the broader landscape context, including how the surrounding agricultural matrix is designed and managed (Wallace et al. 2005; Vandermeer et al. 2007). Protecting biodiversity while sustaining agricultural productivity, indigenous cultures, and rural livelihoods, requires a new approach to conservation, particularly in regions such as Mesoamerica, where substantial habitat conversion has already occurred. In contrast to the prevailing trend of managing protected areas and productive lands separately, we propose integrated landscape management in which conservation and production units within the agricultural matrix are managed jointly for long-term sustainability. We do not advocate agricultural intensification to spare further forest conversion (e.g., Green et al. 2005) because this approach is unlikely to have the intended outcome, for reasons discussed elsewhere (Vandermeer & Perfecto 2005, 2007; Matson & Vitousek 2006). Instead conservation efforts should be based on the recognition that how agriculture is conducted and how different land uses are distributed spatially and temporally determine the region's biodiversity (Perfecto & Vandermeer 1997; McNeely & Scherr 2003). Lasting conservation will therefore require alliances among conservation biologists, farmers, and land managers to actively plan the future of Mesoamerican landscapes. Here we use an integrated landscape approach to highlight opportunities for achieving long-term conservation in Mesoamerica. We provide an overview of the potential for agricultural landscapes and traditional smallholder farming to conserve biodiversity, propose an urgent action agenda to guide conservation in agricultural landscapes and stem the loss of biodiversity and traditional farming systems, and outline key socioeconomic, legal, and political conditions needed for successful implementation of the action plan. Although our examples and recommendations focus on Mesoamerica, our approach is relevant to other regions where there are similar challenges to conserving biodiversity in human-modified landscapes. An increasing number of studies in Mesoamerica show that certain agricultural landscapes and traditional smallholder practices contribute to biodiversity conservation (e.g., Estrada & Coates-Estrada 2002; Daily et al. 2003; Mayfield & Daily 2005) and at the same time contribute to increased food production and rural income (Pretty et al. 2003). In particular, heterogeneous agricultural landscapes that retain abundant tree cover (as forest fragments, fallows, riparian areas, live fences, dispersed trees, or shade canopies) provide complementary habitats, resources, and landscape connectivity for a significant portion of the original biota (e.g., Harvey et al. 2006a; Sekercioglu et al. 2007). Landscape configurations that connect forest patches, maintain a diverse array of habitats, and retain high structural and floristic complexity generally conserve more species than landscapes lacking connectivity or habitat complexity (Benton et al. 2003; Bennett et al. 2006). In addition, agricultural landscapes with abundant tree cover serve as buffers for remaining natural areas (Wallace et al. 2005) and contribute regionally to the maintenance of important ecosystem services, such as natural pest management, carbon sequestration, and water and soil conservation (Daily 1997; Soto-Pinto et al. 2002). Within agricultural landscapes, forested and nonforested habitats contribute to biodiversity conservation. Forest fragments, riparian forests, tree plantations, and other types of remnant and introduced tree cover serve as habitats for many species, enhance landscape connectivity, and retain potential for forest regeneration and restoration (Chazdon 2003; Harvey et al. 2006a). Nevertheless, other types of land uses, such as diverse coffee agroforestry (e.g., Moguel & Toledo 1999; Komar 2006), cocoa agroforestry (Rice & Greenberg 2000; Harvey et al. 2006b), silvopastoral systems (Harvey et al. 2005b, 2006a), and traditional agroecological land uses (such as diverse polycultures, organic farming, and swidden agriculture; Finegan & Nasi 2004) also harbor high levels of both wild and agricultural biodiversity and offer much greater conservation value than the agroindustrial systems that typically replace them. In general, biodiversity-friendly land uses are those that mimic the structural and floristic diversity of native vegetation and rely the least on agrochemicals (Tscharntke et al. 2005). The diverse agroecology systems and landscapes described above are typically (but not always) managed by smallholders (campesinos) and indigenous farmers. Although most environmentally friendly farming practices are not scale-specific in principle, landscapes that are composed of many small farms often demonstrate a high potential for sustaining both biodiversity and rural livelihoods (Rosset 1999). Small farmers are more likely to know their land intimately, embrace complexity and multifunctionality, retain multiple traditional varieties, focus on inputs of knowledge and labor rather than purchased agrochemicals and mechanization, and grow food for nearby consumption instead of commodities for export (Netting 1993; Nazarea 2006). Thus, conservation of biodiversity will often be well served by policies that favor smallholders, promote diverse farming landscapes, and support dissemination of traditional practices and agroecological knowledge (Castillo & Toledo 2000). On the basis of existing evidence and experiences, we propose an action agenda to seize opportunities to reconcile farming and biodiversity conservation and to respond to the immediate threats of biodiversity loss and unsustainable farming. The goal of the action agenda is to achieve sustainable and resilient landscapes in which conservation and agricultural production objectives are accomplished in mutually reinforcing ways. The specific conservation goals are to conserve plant and animal biodiversity; maintain intact habitats, ecological communities, and ecosystem functions; buffer existing protected areas; maintain landscape connectivity; and retain landscape resilience to disturbance and climate change. The agricultural goals are to fulfill human livelihood needs, sustain yields, conserve indigenous and smallholder agroecosystems and associated knowledge and culture, diversify products, minimize reliance on external inputs, and reduce vulnerability to natural disasters and climate change. Our action agenda contains six strategies (Table 1). The first consists of working with stakeholders in a participatory approach to identify priority landscapes where action for conservation and agricultural sustainability will bring the greatest results. Numerous tools already identify areas with high conservation value and the greatest need for protection (e.g., key biodiversity areas [Eken et al. 2004] and priority ecoregions [Olson & Dinerstein 2002]), but these tools rarely include information on rural livelihoods and agricultural systems. We advocate combining the analysis of biodiversity hotspots (Myers et al. 2000) with the identification of rural hotspots, where traditional smallholder livelihoods are most vulnerable and where agroecological systems and knowledge are being rapidly lost. This approach would allow the identification of landscapes where conservation priorities and rural development priorities overlap and where integration is most likely to succeed. Landscapes that are likely to emerge as priorities include those located near protected areas or in key biological corridors, those that conserve high diversity of traditional and indigenous crops, and those with high forest and tree cover that are being rapidly encroached upon by intensive agriculture or urbanization. In contrast, agricultural landscapes that are already dominated by agroindustrial production (such as industrially grown sugarcane, pineapple, or banana) are less likely to warrant attention because the chances of reconciling farming and biodiversity conservation there are slim. The second strategy is to address major threats to biodiversity within priority landscapes. Common threats include illegal logging, irresponsible use of agrochemicals, forest degradation by cattle grazing, shortening of fallows, unsustainable collection of firewood and other products, and conversion of diversified agricultural systems to agroindustrial monocultures with low biodiversity value (Carrillo & Vaughan 1994; Harvey et al. 2005a). Measures should be taken to mitigate these threats. For example, planting multipurpose trees on farms offers an alternative to firewood extraction from native forests (Barrance & Hellin 2003); integrated fire management (including prescribed burns, establishment of fire breaks, and training in sensible fire use) reduces unintended burning of native forests (Myers 2006); and adopting organic practices and integrated pest management can reduce dependence on pesticides (Kogan 1998; Morales & Perfecto 2000). Nevertheless, these promising approaches need to be applied systematically over large areas, with active participation and leadership of local rural communities (Nelson 1994). The protection of remaining native habitat (whether intact forest, wetland, or grassland) constitutes the third key strategy for conserving biodiversity and maintaining rural livelihoods in agricultural landscapes. Native habitat protection should continue to form the cornerstone of conservation activities because they provide resources to native species, maintain intact ecological communities, serve as genetic sources for recolonization of the agricultural matrix, and buffer against extreme weather events and climate change (Bengtsson et al. 2003; Taberelli & Gascon 2005). Large, contiguous areas of native habitat and vegetation along riparian areas (that form natural corridors) are of particularly high conservation value and should be priorities. Nevertheless, even small (<5 ha) and degraded forest patches can be important for some species, providing additional resources and landscape connectivity (Sekercioglu et al. 2007). Protecting native habitats within the agricultural landscape also benefits rural communities by providing products and ecosystem services such as pollination, pest management, flood control, and nutrient cycling on which agricultural systems (and farmers) depend (Ricketts 2004; Naidoo & Ricketts 2006). A fourth key strategy is to protect, diversify, and sustainably manage the heterogeneous tree cover within the agricultural matrix. On-farm tree cover contributes to biodiversity conservation by providing additional habitats and resources for plant and animal species and enhancing landscape connectivity (Schroth et al. 2004; Harvey et al. 2005b). In addition, tree cover in pastures and fields confers benefits to farmers, providing products (fruit, wood, fodder for livestock), ameliorating microclimatic conditions, and increasing soil fertility (Nair 1989). Nevertheles, trees may also reduce agricultural productivity through competition for light, water, and nutrients and serve as hosts for pest species (Ong & Huxley 1996). A key challenge is therefore to integrate tree species in densities and spatial arrangements that minimize competition and shading of agricultural land, yet still provide biodiversity benefits. Low densities of trees scattered across the agricultural matrix and linear plantings of trees along farm and field boundaries are often compatible with existing production systems and therefore are easily adopted by farmers (Harvey et al. 2005b). A fifth strategy is to promote and conserve traditional and ecologically based agricultural practices and indigenous knowledge practices, such as agroforestry, swidden agriculture, home gardens, low-input agriculture, polycultures, and traditional milpas. These agroecological systems conserve high levels of both agrobiodiversity and wild biodiversity, ensure better soil management, and minimize agrochemical use. Throughout Mesoamerica, numerous academic, governmental, and nongovernmental organizations (e.g., CATIE, ECOSUR, EARTH, Campesino a Campesino, PROMECAFE, ACICAFOC, Sustainable Agriculture Network; Harvey et al. 2005a) already promote the use of ecological agriculture and traditional knowledge, but these efforts need to be scaled up to cover a greater proportion of the region's agricultural lands and communities. Last, agricultural land that is highly degraded, unproductive, or unsuitable (e.g., prone to erosion or colonized by exotic species) should be reforested or allowed to regenerate naturally (Montagnini 2001; Lamb et al. 2005). Restoration goals can range from restoring soil fertility for agricultural use to establishing tree plantations or forests for timber or biodiversity conservation. Reforestation efforts should include diverse mixtures of native tree species, including species that provide resources to wildlife and species that have high timber value and provide future income to local farmers. Information on many native species that could be used in large-scale restoration efforts is available (e.g., Hooper et al. 2002; Wishnie et al. 2007). Restoration can also be achieved through natural regeneration, especially where remaining tree cover provides a source of propagules. Natural regeneration can be facilitated by fencing off areas to prevent cattle entry (Guevara et al. 2004), permitting light grazing to reduce competition from grasses on tree seedlings (Posada et al. 2000), using cattle to disperse tree seeds (Miceli-Méndez et al. 2007), or retaining isolated trees or live fences that serve as nuclei for natural regeneration (Slocum 2001; Zahawi & Augspurger 2006). The use of enrichment planting in fallows can also facilitate soil restoration (Finegan & Nasi 2004). An efficient implementation of the six strategies outlined above requires that certain enabling conditions be in place at local, regional, and/or national levels. We focus here on 5 major types of programs that could facilitate our agenda: providing economic incentives, strengthening and enforcing legislation, encouraging farmer alliances, promoting sustainable agriculture certification programs, and ensuring political support (Table 2). A variety of economic instruments can be used to encourage farmers to conserve forests, retain tree cover, adopt biodiversity-friendly cropping systems, and to cover additional costs these activities may involve. Payments for environmental services (PES) hold particular promise. A Costa Rican PES scheme, in which farmers receive payments for protecting existing forest and for integrating trees into their farming systems, has worked well (Pagiola et al. 2005a; Zbinden & Lee 2005) and similar schemes are now being applied in Honduras, Guatemala, Mexico, and Nicaragua (Kosoy et al. 2007). Although PES schemes appear to be successful in conserving forest cover, they could have a greater positive impact on rural landscapes and livelihoods if they included payments for a greater diversity of sustainable land uses, removed inappropriate access restrictions (such as minimum land size), lowered transaction costs, and carefully targeted priority landscapes that have the greatest potential to conserve both biodiversity and rural livelihoods (Grieg-Gran et al. 2005; Pagiola et al. 2005b). Another economic tool with potential to reduce the conflict between conservation and farming is carbon financing for either enhancing carbon sequestration (e.g., reforestation, agroforestry, and improved agricultural land management) or reducing emissions from deforestation (Orlando et al. 2002; Moutinho & Schwartzman 2005). Reforestation activities are already eligible for funding under the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) of the Kyoto Protocol, and the rapidly expanding voluntary markets for carbon offer new opportunities for forest restoration and conservation (Bayon et al. 2007). The complexity and high costs of CDM projects have so far generally precluded small landowners and farmer organizations from participating (Boyd et al. 2007), but as the carbon market matures and demand for forestry carbon increases, so will opportunities for farmers. Innovative initiatives, such as the Plan Vivo project in Mexico, which provides smallholder farmers with access to carbon markets, are already paving the way (de Jong et al. 1997; Klooster & Masera 2000). In addition to creating economic incentives, our action agenda requires increasing law enforcement and developing new legislation that restricts deforestation, regulates logging and agrochemical use, oversees zoning regulations and land tenure issues, and promotes conservation of secondary forests, riparian vegetation, and on-farm tree cover (Cullen et al. 2005; Wallace et al. 2005). The 1996 Forestry Law of Costa Rica serves as a model of what can be achieved in the region: the law carefully defines forest (in terms of percent canopy and area), bans forest conversion to other land uses, restricts logging within 15–50 m (depending on slope) on either side of rivers, and establishes the framework for the PES scheme that pays landowners for forest conservation and reforestation (Asamblea Legislativa 1996). Drafting appropriate legislation is only the first step, however; without enforcement, laws are ineffective. Illegal logging recently accounted for 75–85% of hardwood production in Honduras and nearly 50% in Nicaragua (Richards et al. 2003). Increasing enforcement of forestry and environmental laws by systematically monitoring forest cover, applying penalties, and properly managing harvesting permits is critical for forest conservation. In addition, legislation that facilitates the establishment of private reserves, conservation easements, buffer zones, and conservation corridors will likely encourage natural habitat conservation on private lands (Langholz et al. 2000; Wallace et al. 2005). The strengthening of alliances among farmers, agronomists, extension workers, foresters, and conservation biologists will also promote ecologically sustainable production systems and lead to genuinely collaborative approaches to biodiversity conservation and food security (Morales et al. 2007; Vandermeer & Perfecto 2007). The active participation of the more than 12 million Mesoamerican farmers (CIA 2006) will be critical for long-term conservation gains. Many institutions, alliances, and networks that promote interdisciplinary partnerships already exist, but these often lack sufficient resources to be effective, cover only a small proportion of the region's stakeholders, or have more-limited agendas than the integrated approach we advocate. Funds are urgently required to support these types of organizations and regional initiatives. Our action agenda could also be enabled by efforts to link small farmers with niche markets for agricultural and forest commodities that have been produced with minimal negative impact on biodiversity. These biodiversity-friendly enterprises are largely supported by private-sector certification programs led by Rainforest Alliance, Fair Trade, Smithsonian Migratory Bird Center, International Federation of Organic Agriculture Movements, Forest Stewardship Council, and others (Gullison 2003; Raynolds et al. 2007). Most of the schemes require producers to comply with environmental standards, such as planting trees along roads, controlling erosion, limiting agrochemical use, and planting native vegetation along rivers. Many also protect farm workers and ensure they are paid fair wages, enjoy safe working conditions, and drink clean water. Nevertheless, compliance or enforcement of standards is often weak, transaction costs and paperwork often limit participation, and incentives are insufficient to attract high levels of participation (Gullison 2003; Molnar 2003). Finally, broad political support at all levels is needed to catalyze the strategies outlined here. Already, there are positive signs that Mesoamerican governments are aware of the importance of biodiversity conservation and the need to link conservation with sustainable rural development. All Mesoamerican countries are signatories of the Convention on Biological Diversity and have thus agreed to develop biodiversity action plans that ensure protection and sustainable use of biodiversity (CBD 2005). In addition, there are many regional programs (e.g., Plan Ambiental de la Región Centroamericana, Estratégia Forestal Centroamericana, and Iniciativa Mesoamericana de Desarrollo Sostenible) and even a Regional Institute for Biodiversity (created in 2005) that address, to some degree, the need for reconciling biodiversity conservation and rural development. The countries have also collaborated to develop the Mesoamerican Biological Corridor, an effort to link existing protected areas within and between countries to facilitate movement of plant and animal species (Miller et al. 2001). To be successful, this large-scale initiative will require the careful management of the agricultural landscapes in which the protected areas are embedded and will depend on the strategies outlined in our agenda. Yet despite the generally positive and promising political arena, there is a dearth of action on the ground. In many cases the political will has not yet been translated into concrete actions, funding for implementation is inadequate, and support for technical assistance and capacity building is lacking. Governments must place greater attention on implementing their vision for sustainable development in rural regions with adequate resources and knowledge. We call for a new approach to biodiversity conservation within human-dominated Mesoamerican landscapes—one that unites a focus on ecologically sustainable agriculture with existing efforts in protected areas to achieve lasting conservation outcomes at local and regional levels. This new approach recognizes farmers as stakeholders in conserving biodiversity and actively solicits farmers as partners to create resilient landscapes that foster wildlife and preserve rural livelihoods and local knowledge. Our action agenda provides strategies for reconciling farming and conservation and identifies key socioeconomic, legal, and political actions that could enable their adoption. If implemented broadly, our agenda could catalyze significant positive changes for both conservation and farming. Action is urgently needed, however. Landscapes may soon be so degraded that conservation and restoration will no longer be effective, and traditional knowledge may be lost forever. We therefore urgently call conservationists, agronomists, farmers, decision makers, and other stakeholders to actively design and manage entire landscapes to secure a future for both biodiversity and rural livelihoods in Mesoamerica. This article was written by a subgroup of the Working Group on Biodiversity and Conservation Value of Agricultural Landscapes of Mesoamerica supported by the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis (NCEAS) funded by the National Science Foundation (grant DEB-0072909), the University of California, and the University of California's Santa Barbara campus. The working group was organized by R.C. and D.G. We are grateful to the 3 anonymous reviewers who provided valuable suggestions for improving the manuscript.","citation":"Célia A. Harvey et al.

Acknowledged by world leaders as a global problem, land degradation has been taken seriously in three ways: its extent and the proportion of the global population affected; international environmental policy responses; and its inter‐relation with other global environmental issues such as biodiversity. Messages about land degradation have, however, suffered from abuses, which have rendered appropriate policy responses ineffective. For control to be effective, the paper argues that the synergies between land degradation and the two other main global environmental change components (biodiversity and climate change) should be more fully exploited. A focus on the interlinkages, of which there are six possible permutations, is fully supported by empirical findings that suggest that land degradation control would not only technically be better served by addressing aspects of biodiversity and climate change but also that international financing mechanisms and the major donors would find this more acceptable. The DPSIR (Driving Force, Pressure, State, Impacts, Response) conceptual framework model is used to illustrate how land degradation control could be more effective, tackling not only the drivers of change but also major developmental issues such as poverty and food insecurity.

has been touted as a source of finance for biodiversity conservation. Recent work has suggested that the bioprospecting value of the “marginal unit” of genetic resources is likely to be vanishingly small, creating essentially no conservation incentive. This result is shown to flow specifically from a stylized description of the research process as one of brute‐force testing, unaided by an organizing scientific framework. Scientific models channel research effort toward leads for which the expected productivity of discoveries is highest. Leads of unusual promise then command information rents, associated with their role in reducing the costs of search. When genetic materials are abundant, information rents are virtually unaffected by increases in the profitability of product discovery and decline as technology improvements lower search costs. Numerical simulation results suggest that, under plausible conditions, the bioprospecting value of certain genetic resources could be large enough to support market‐based conservation of biodiversity.","citation":"Gordon C.

principal aim of this study is to get a better sense of what the World Bank (WB) needs to know in order to engage Indigenous Peoples (IPs) more effectively in biodiversity conservation projects and programs. It is in this sense that the reporting is geared to Bank Task Team leaders, advisors, directors, and managers and also government and nongovernmental organization (NGO) personnel engaged in biodiversity conservation programs. Indigenous peoples might also benefit from the report's presentation of tools to seeking international funding for biodiversity-related activities in their ancestral territories. In addition, the report assesses some of the current forms of engagement with indigenous peoples in biodiversity and identifies concrete recommendations for improving that engagement. These recommendations will give Bank management an opportunity to lead the way among many development agencies and governments toward different forms of engaging indigenous peoples; respecting and realizing the rights to their territories, culture, and spirituality; enhancing their environment and development; and satisfying the IPs' aspirations contained in the United Nations declaration on the rights of indigenous peoples. The report's findings are relevant to other Bank's programs such as the climate change strategic framework and the carbon finance initiatives and can be used to incorporate the lessons learned from 18 years of biodiversity portfolio experience into these new programs. The findings of this report support the contention that engaging IPs more effectively in biodiversity conservation represents a win-win situation.","citation":"Claudia Sobrevila (2008)","page":1}

challenge of building biodiversity business is not trivial. Biodiversity is still largely neglected by private finance. There is a need to develop new business models and market mechanisms for biodiversity conservation, and to persuade the public and policy makers that biodiversity (or component ecosystem services) can be conserved on a commercial basis. Based on extensive consultation and analysis, the authors of this new report conclude that there are numerous pro-biodiversity business opportunities that can generate positive financial returns as well as real biodiversity benefits.","citation":"Joshua Bishop et al.

New financing mechanisms for tropical forest conservation, based on payments for ecosystem services, often involve the development of new business models. Suppliers of ecosystem services may include existing land users (e.g., farmers, foresters, tourism operators) or new business ventures (e.g., carbon accountants and traders, conservation bankers). Developing viable business models for biodiversity conservation is a major challenge, due to: the complexity of biodiversity itself (i.e., genes, species, and ecosystems, many still undocumented); the various linkages between business and biodiversity (which may be an economic input, output, competing resource use, or victim of pollution); insufficient consensus on biodiversity conservation priorities and performance indicators applicable at the enterprise level; weak or missing property rights, liability regimes, and/or incentive measures to penalize biodiversity loss and reward conservation effort; and concerns about potential adverse social impacts. This study presents a synthesis of experience across a range of sectors to develop more sustainable business models for biodiversity conservation, identifies key success factors, and outlines a new approach to building a biodiversity business that combines policy innovation, business development assistance, and financial support.

service approaches to conservation are being championed as a new strategy for conservation, under the hypothesis that they will broaden and deepen support for biodiversity protection. Where traditional approaches focus on setting aside land by purchasing property rights, ecosystem service approaches aim to engage a much wider range of places, people, policies, and financial resources in conservation. This is particularly important given projected intensification of human impacts, with rapid growth in population size and individual aspirations. Here we use field research on 34 ecosystem service (ES) projects and 26 traditional biodiversity (BD) projects from the Western Hemisphere to test whether ecosystem service approaches show signs of realizing their putative potential. We find that the ES projects attract on average more than four times as much funding through greater corporate sponsorship and use of a wider variety of finance tools than BD projects. ES projects are also more likely to encompass working landscapes and the people in them. We also show that, despite previous concern, ES projects not only expand opportunities for conservation, but they are no less likely than BD projects to include or create protected areas. Moreover, they do not draw down limited financial resources for conservation but rather engage a more diverse set of funders. We also found, however, that monitoring of conservation outcomes in both cases is so infrequent that it is impossible to assess the effectiveness of either ES or BD approaches.","citation":"Rebecca L.

paper is specifically concerned with economic perspectives on nature tourism in developing countries. Nature tourism is particularly important in the context of sustainable development because it offers the potential of mobilizing resources through the private sector which can contribute to local and national economic development while providing an incentive for conservation land uses and helping to finance biodiversity conservation. But analysts have argued that there is a significant gap between nature tourism's actual and potential contribution to sustainable development. From a conservation perspective, most governments have not invested sufficient attention or resources in managing the natural assets. Unregulated tourism development has exposed sensitive sites of ecological or cultural value to the risk of degradation. The overall growth potential and some promising individual cases do suggest that nature tourism is an important sector where environmental conservation may effectively be combined with economic development in remote rural areas of developing countries on a meaningful scale. The policy-making priorities generally lie in four areas: a) increasing and capturing more the of the net economic benefits; b) contributing more to local economic development; c) mitigating environmental impacts; and d) helping to finance biodiversity conservation.","citation":"Michael P.

of the most important reasons for the degradation of biodiversity, in mountain areas and elsewhere, is that the people who make land use decisions often receive few or no benefits from biodiversity conservation. Understandably, therefore, they generally ignore potential biodiversity benefits when choosing land use practices. The end result is that biodiversity is often lost, as are many other off-site benefits such as the regulation of hydrological flows. Efforts to enhance biodiversity conservation need to take account of the constraints faced by individual land users, who decide what practices to adopt on their land. Over the years, a variety of efforts have been made to boost the profitability of biodiversity-friendly practices for land users, with mixed results. A further approach, which has received increasing attention in recent years, is to provide direct payments for the provision of environmental services such as biodiversity conservation. The simple logic of Payments for Environmental Services (PES) is that compensating land users for the environmental services a given land use provides, makes them more likely to choose that land use rather than another. The Regional Integrated Silvopastoral Ecosystem Management Project, which is being implemented by the World Bank with financing from the Global Environment Facility (GEF), is piloting the use of PES as a means of generating biodiversity conservation and carbon sequestration services in watersheds at three sites in Colombia, Costa Rica, and Nicaragua.","citation":"Stefano Pagiola et al.

Sub‐Saharan Africa continues to face the daunting challenge of alleviating poverty due to slow economic growth. In southern Africa, most countries are adopting policies that promote the integration of biodiversity conservation and rural development to contribute to rural poverty alleviation. Numerous approaches have been undertaken in this endeavour, including Transfrontier Parks (TFPs) and Transfrontier Conservation Areas (TFCAs). This paper discusses some of the limitations of the TFPs. In conclusion I posit that unlike TFPs, which are state controlled and managed, TFCAs, which promote multi‐land use and multi‐stakeholder participation are attainable and have a higher probability of sustaining biodiversity conservation and contributing to the alleviation of rural poverty, if: (i) areas of high biodiversity conservation within communal areas can be identified, zoned and leveraged to biodiversity conservation and managed in partnership between the communities and the private sector; (ii) local communities can secure legal rights to their customary land being devoted to biodiversity conservation and use such pieces of land as collateral in negotiating partnerships with the private sector in developing conservation‐based enterprises; (iii) functional community natural resource governance institutions can be established and empowered to represent their constituencies in securing fair equity from profits made from sustainable use of the conserved biodiversity assets and tourism businesses; (iv) concerted effort can be invested in developing and implementing family planning and fertility reduction strategies that would slow down human population growth to levels that can be sustained by the available natural resources; and (v) if sustainable financing mechanisms can be developed, and the governance of protected areas occurring in the TFCAs can be broadened to include other stakeholders.","citation":"Simon M.

review of some of the key issues of ecotourism and nature-based tourism highlights the complexity of using tourism as a tool for conservation. Five key benefits for conservation which can be appropriately targeted in the context of most ecotourism and nature-based initiatives are: 1) a source of financing for parks and conservation; 2) economic justification for park protection; 3) economic alternatives for local people to reduce exploitation of conservation areas and resources; 4) constituency building which promotes conservation; and 5) an impetus for private conservation efforts. This paper reviews experiences with ecotourism across the globe, with selected case studies taken from Australia, Belize, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Indonesia, Nepal, Niger, and Uganda. Despite tremendous differences in size and management of protected areas, cultures, types of ecotourism enterprises, and government involvement, in most cases, ecotourism and nature-based tourism have not lived up to expectations. Nevertheless, they remain a potential avenue for conservation. To generate benefits for biodiversity conservation, a number of conditions have to be met, among them, competitive sites; ability of authorities to design, implement, and mandate sustainable ecotourism consistent with protected area objectives; tourist fees collected must reflect management costs; and revenues collected must first be directed to the parks where collected, with the rest applied to national conservation.","citation":"Katrina Brandon (1996)","page":1}

Besides supplying the growing demand for wood, plantations and agroforestry systems provide environmental services such as carbon sequestration and recovery of biodiversity. Several countries of Central America have recently started incentive programs to encourage plantation and agroforestry development. In Costa Rica, Payment for Environmental Services (PES) provides subsidies to farmers for plantations and agroforestry systems. Funding for these subsidies comes from a special tax on gasoline, and from external sources sought by FONAFIFO (National Fund for Forestry Financing). These plantations and agroforestry systems are established on degraded land by farmers who are often advised by local NGOs (non-governmental organizations) or by research institutions that have practical experience in the region. Gathering information on species selection, plantation silviculture, and environmental services provided by plantations and agroforestry systems is important to the success of these systems. These incentive programs can also serve as a model for starting or modifying similar programs in other countries with comparable ecological and socioeconomic conditions. This paper presents experiences with native species plantations over the past twelve years in Costa Rica. Data on volume, biomass production and recuperation of biodiversity are presented. We recommend the establishment of government incentives for reforestation and agroforestry systems with native Species.","citation":"Florencia Montagnini et al. (2004)","page":1}

article delineates trajectories of the glocalization of law and maps the changing contours of legal pluralism using empirical material on World Bank financed infrastructure and biodiversity projects in India. The role of international institutions, social movements and NGOs, which challenge the monopoly of the state over the production of law and the definition of the common good, is analysed with reference to conflicts over privatization of natural resources, struggles against forced displacement and loss of livelihood as well as the complaints on behalf of indigenous communities before the World Bank Inspection Panel. It is argued that despite scattered sovereignties in the new architecture of global governance, the state remains a central albeit contested terrain. Its pivotal role in selectively transposing conditionalities, law and policies into the national arena as well as its strategies to avoid accountability are foregrounded against the attempts by civil society actors to use national and international legal platforms to enforce compliance with environmental and human rights standards.","citation":"Shalini Randeria (2003)","page":1}

biologists are confronted with a number of basic questions in their quest to conserve the earth's biological resources. I have distilled these to the following: What are we trying to conserve? Where are the most important places in which to conserve it? How should we go about doing conservation? Who can best carry out conservation? Unfortunately, despite broad agreement on global conservation goals, working on the details of conservation has more often than not resulted in conflict within the conservation movement and divided conservationists to the detriment of what they are trying to accomplish. This conflict has often been to the advantage of those who wish to discredit the conservation movement. It is clear to me that there is a devil in the detail of biodiversity conservation. Answering the first question—What are we trying to conserve?—has probably been the easiest and has engendered the greatest amount of agreement. Biodiversity is the conservation target for governments, U.N. institutions, development agencies, and, of course, conservation organizations. It has become so omnipresent that there is an entire international convention, the Convention on Biological Diversity, devoted to it. Yet even with broad agreement, biodiversity has been defined in many ways, many often vague and difficult to assess (Redford & Richter 1999). It is this vagueness that makes it difficult to determine the where, how, and who of biodiversity conservation. Attempting to identify the most important places in which to conserve biodiversity has led conservation biologists to develop strategic, science-based methodologies for establishing conservation priorities. These methodologies have generally addressed threat and species numbers ( Myers et al. 2000 ) and representation ( Olson & Dinerstein 1998 ). The disturbing side of developing such methodologies has been their marketing. We have seen the production of large picture books supporting megadiversity countries and hotspots, and we have seen posters of representational ecoregions with quotes from learned professionals touting the approach as the most important breakthrough in biodiversity conservation. These are the materials that are used to convince the donor ( and voting ) public and government and institutional funders that the scientific community is lined up in support of a specific method and, by inference, that it is better than the rest. This promotion of one method over another in the race for donor funding has been counterproductive. Luckily, the overlap between different methods of deciding where biodiversity should be conserved is extensive, and a number of organizations have adopted the geographical priorities of others, recognizing that the time and resources required to invent another method of establishing biodiversity conservation priorities would be a waste. The real problems start with the question of how should we go about doing conservation. Today, more than ever, we are seeing a plethora of conservation approaches, ranging from calls for more intensive protection ( Oates 1999; Terborgh et al. 2002 ) to greater community control over biodiversity conservation ( Western & Wright 1994; Hulme & Murphree 2001 ). In most cases these approaches are scientifically sound and have the common goal of conserving biological diversity. So far, so good. The problem is in the race for funding. Conservation organizations have tended to promote and market their own single solutions to biodiversity conservation problems at the expense of other approaches. Such a strategy is dangerous. It is unusual for such approaches to have undergone extensive field-testing. More often than not they are based on a set of theories about how we would like conservation to work, and the assumptions upon which these theories are based are rarely explicitly acknowledged. As we have seen over the years, one can shoot holes in almost any of the approaches tried to date. For example, protected areas are a core component of biodiversity conservation. Yet the method for establishing protected areas is fraught with difficulties. The process usually has involved removing those people living on the newly protected land, often without compensation and sometimes by force. In almost all cases, the result is a park surrounded by people who were excluded from the planning of the area, do not understand its purpose, derive little or no benefit from the money poured into its creation, and hence do not support its existence. As a result, local communities develop a lasting distrust of park authorities, in part because of the glaring lack of attention those authorities, supported by conservationists, have paid to the link between park ecology, the survival of wildlife, and the livelihood of displaced people. Out of the experience with protected areas came the development of integrated conservation and development projects, or ICDPs, through which it was believed that conservation would be more successful if the focus was on the welfare of communities in and around protected areas. Encouraged by the frantic quest for examples of sustainable development, ICDPs exploded in popularity, rapidly advancing from an untested idea attracting seed money to \"best practice\" for biodiversity conservation. The fact that conservation organizations were perhaps not suited to work in the social and economic realms was missed in all the excitement. Successes have been few and far between, and today an expanding barrage of mostly critical literature has fuelled concern among organizations implementing and financing ICDPs. The problems experienced with protected areas and ICDPs have resulted in conservation organizations developing a number of new approaches. These have grown out of the limitations of simple site-based project activities. These new, more complex approaches are attempting to \"vertically integrate\" site-based projects, surrounding land uses, and policy initiatives. A major challenge for these emerging landscape- or ecoregion-scale approaches will be to position other complementary conservation activities operating on a variety of spatial and temporal scales. Although these approaches are in their infancy, it already seems clear that their success will depend on the links between their constituent parts. In the first analysis of its kind, Redford and colleagues show in this issue of Conservation Biology that there is greater overlap between approaches than was perhaps generally believed. This argues for a broad range of biodiversity conservation tools being available and, more important, marketed by all organizations; simple, one-organization solutions will not work. Perhaps most critical, these efforts to conserve biodiversity cannot be made in isolation. They must involve effective partnerships to address the larger-scale problems that defy local solutions. This leads us to the last question: Who has the experience most appropriate to doing the conservation? Traditionally, conservation organizations have been reluctant to collaborate among themselves or with other professions. This go-it-alone mentality has often been the result of the perceived need for different groups to have their own easily identified portfolios of projects that can be marketed to prospective donors. This has resulted in endless claims and counterclaims over conservation approaches that are themselves a sort of territorial battle of knowledge and experience—a way to show the donors who does conservation right, and best. Such ownership has promoted a lack of collaboration and partnership. It has also fostered in organizations an unwillingness to try a range of approaches; they rely instead on those developed in-house and vigorously defend them from any competing method. It is clear, however, that as conservation approaches have become greater in scale and broader in context, conservation organizations do not have all the skills necessary to get the job done. McShane and Newby ( 2003) found that many of the constraints on biodiversity conservation involved issues with which conservationists tended to be inexperienced or uncomfortable. Conservation organizations must work harder at reaching out within their own profession and to other disciplines. Recently, collaboration and the development of partnerships has moved beyond rhetoric. Newly developed partnerships include the World Wildlife Fund ( WWF ) and CARE in East Africa and Conservation International, the Wildlife Conservation Society, and WWF in the Congo Basin. At the policy level, Conservation International and WWF have written the World Bank (with whom they both have a partnership ) expressing concern over proposed changes to the bank's operational policy for forests. By bringing together a number of different conservation organizations to look at many of the existing approaches to conserving biodiversity, Redford et al. ( 2003 ) have taken an important step in promoting such coordination and collaboration. These are all moves in the right direction, but collaboration must be maintained and nurtured. The issues of funding, fundraising, and project ownership must be part of the process. Biodiversity conservation's devil is the competition for donor funding. We all know that successful biodiversity conservation requires money. Unfortunately, in the pursuit of funds, conservation organizations find themselves making claims based on little more than theory. This marketing of conservation approaches has resulted in a dogmatic debate, outwardly over how best to conserve the world's biodiversity, which is a necessary question, but behind the scenes over how to get the funds before someone else does, which is not. Conservation organizations and the conservation biologists that work for them must look closely at themselves. We all know what we want to conserve, and we broadly agree on where we should be doing conservation. We have a number of approaches to help us do the work, and we know that we are not expert at everything that needs to be done. It is time for the conservation community to put organizational competition aside and work together for biodiversity conservation. There are a few good examples beginning, and we must be build on these.","citation":"Thomas O. McShane (2003)","page":1}

I reviewed some of the financial mechanisms for biodiversity conservation activities in Brazil. There is a heavy dependence on the public sector, but macroeconomic policies aimed at reducing government spending have resulted in reduced budgets dedicated to public conservation measures. The financial constraints for environmental protection have also increased because of a reduction in foreign aid. Positive signs for the immediate future, however, come from new initiatives that create economic instruments to finance conservation. The most important initiatives include conservation criteria for tax redistribution; environmental compensation; water charges; royalties for electricity, petroleum, and natural gas; tradable obligations for forest reserves; and voluntary measures on the part of the business sector. Resources created from these initiatives have different origins and are managed by different public agencies according to varying laws and policies, so their efficient implementation will require that the institutions involved in biodiversity conservation in Brazil establish a minimum set of common priorities and objectives.","citation":"Carlos Eduardo Frickmann Young (2005)","page":1}

depredation has become a significant problem across the snow leopard's (Panthera uncia) range in Central Asia, being most severe in and near protected areas. Such predation, especially incidents of surplus killing, in which five to 100 or more sheep and goats are lost in a single night, almost inevitably leads herders to retaliate by killing rare or endangered carnivores like snow leopard, wolf, and lynx. Ironically, such loss can be avoided by making the night-time enclosures predator-proof, improving animal husbandry techniques, educating herders on wildlife conservation and the importance of protecting the natural prey base, and by providing economic incentives like handicrafts skills training and marketing, along with carefully planned ecotourism trekking and guiding. The author explores innovative conservation initiatives in the Himalaya (Ladakh and Tibet) and Mongolia, which also build local capacity, self-reliance, and stewardship for nature using Appreciative Participatory Planning and Action, or APPA, techniques. The most sound conservation investments are those contingent upon establishing direct linkages with biodiversity protection, ensuring co-financing and reciprocal responsibility for project activities, encouraging the full participation of all stakeholders, and assuring regular monitoring and evaluation of the village-based agreements (embodied in Action Plans).","citation":"Rodney Jackson & Rinchen Wangchuk (2001)","page":1}

need apes as much as the apes need the forests. They are the gardeners of the forest - keystone species in the ecology of African and Southeast Asian forests, dispersing seeds, creating light gaps and pruning branch-tips whilst feeding. Their habitat comprises two of the planet's three major tropical forest blocks that are essential for global climate regulation. But the economic pressures that are destroying ape habitats are much greater than current available conservation finance. This unique case study from the Kibale national park illustrates how biological research has had diverse consequences for conservation. It examines effects on habitat management, community relations, ecotourism and training. Lessons learned from this project over the last 20 years will inspire researchers and conservationists to work together to promote biodiversity through field projects.","citation":"Richard W.

Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD) in developing countries is a new financial mechanism that is being proposed for the post-2012 climate change regime under the auspices of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).Successful agreement on a future REDD mechanism would represent a substantial and unprecedented development in the creation of an international mechanism to help internalise the carbon-related ecosystem services from forests and could make a significant contribution to addressing the global climate change challenge.Forests also play a key role in the provision of biodiversity, as well as other non-carbon ecosystem services.The Bali Action Plan recognises that action to support REDD \"can promote co-benefits and complement the aims and objectives of other relevant international conventions and agreements\".A notable example is that of the Convention on Biological Diversity.This report examines how biodiversity co-benefits in REDD can be enhanced, both at the design and implementation level.It discusses potential biodiversity implications of different REDD design options that have been put forward in the international climate change negotiations and proceeds by examining how the creation of additional biodiversity-specific incentives could be used to complement a REDD mechanism, so as to target biodiversity benefits directly.Key design elements of a REDD mechanism that need to be agreed upon, and are likely to have implications for biodiversity, include: the scope of the mechanism; financing; the establishment of baselines/reference levels; and permanence issues, amongst others.For example, a market-based approach to REDD financing (rather than a fund-based approach) is likely to generate substantially larger volumes of financing (by directly engaging the private sector), which would enable more REDD activities, greater forest areas being conserved, and hence larger biodiversity co-benefits.Overall, a well-designed REDD mechanism is likely to deliver substantial biodiversity co-benefits since avoided deforestation and degradation implies a decline in habitat destruction and thus in biodiversity loss.However, some of the international REDD design elements may pose potential risks to biodiversity, for example via afforestation and reforestation activities that resulted in mono-plantations, and appropriate safeguards may be needed.At the implementation level, further efforts can help ensure that biodiversity co-benefits can be mainstreamed into REDD activities in an efficient and informed manner.For example:  Some international financing would be well-invested in economically evaluating and geographically mapping biodiversity and ecosystem services benefits as this can provide an important input to national REDD planning and implementation.An improved database on national biodiversity will increase the likelihood of using this information to achieve and maximise REDD co-benefits. If a REDD mechanism is successful in avoiding deforestation and degradation, it could free up financial biodiversity resources from areas where

The Coral Triangle Initiative (CTI) in south-east Asia offers a new opportunity to address marine conservation in this global biodiversity hotspot. This commentary offers an analysis of the concept of networked marine protected areas (MPAs) which form the cornerstone of this agenda. Attention is drawn to the value of the scientific rationale for implementing such a network, along with the ability for component MPAs to be self-financing and managed in accordance with local environmental conditions and the needs of resident communities. It is concluded that the current model of MPA networks as represented in the CTI needs to build upon existing MPA practices, recognize the varied socioeconomic, political and environmental characteristics of the region and adopt an adaptive approach to MPA implementation if it is to offer genuine prospects for conservation.","citation":"Julian Clifton (2009)","page":1}

their Policy Forum “Direct payments to conserve biodiversity” (29 Nov., p. [1718][1]), P. J. Ferraro and A. Kiss argue for more direct payments to conserve biodiversity instead of indirect interventions that are coupled to social-economic projects at the level of the rural community, because “such initiatives rarely work.” The authors admit that there are many disadvantages to direct payments, e.g., inequitable land tenure, poor legislation, and possible misuse; however, such obstacles would also apply to indirect methods. They state, “the cheapest way to get something you want is to pay for what you want” (p. 1719).\n\nIndeed, indirect social-economic interventions are not cheap and may not lead to clearly quantifiable conservation results. However, cost-efficiency is not the only consideration in conserving biodiversity. Duration is another important criterion. Direct payments are probably very effective in the short term; the authors present many examples. But, when the payment stops, continuation of conservation is uncertain because the external motivation has been taken away, or to put it more simply, “no pay, no care.” The loss of biodiversity is an irreversible process; direct payments may therefore only be successful if they pave the way for durable conservation practices. Otherwise, direct payments may be a waste of money because a long-lasting continuation of costly measures for the protection of collective goods as biodiversity or nature is not guaranteed in a world that is primarily driven by economic rules.\n\nIn addition, direct payments stress a vision of nature where countable, measurable, and monetary aspects dominate. There is nothing wrong with such a quantification of nature if we realize its shortcoming: Monetarization of nature may imply that nonnature alternatives that deliver the same service can be substituted for nature. In contrast, ethical, aesthetic, and spiritual motives for nature conservation ([1][2]) often imply the irreplaceability of nature. It is important to base valuation and conservation of nature on such robust motives that resist temporary, threatening trends. Debate and education are therefore important indirect tools ([2][3]).\n\nWe may conclude that conservation should be rooted in the life and mind of involved people to be successful in the long run. The view of Ferraro and Kiss matters, but we should look at direct payments as part of a wider perspective. For example, direct payment can function as a start-up method for more sustainable, locally embedded approaches or should be applied when direct, short-term intervention is needed because of a threatening catastrophe. Unfortunately, this latter situation seems often to be the case.\n\n1. [↵][4]1. J. A. A. Swart, 2. H. J. van der Windt, 3. J. Keulartz\n , Restor. Ecol. 9, 230 (2001).\n [OpenUrl][5][CrossRef][6][Web of Science][7]\n\n2. [↵][8]1. D. W. Orr\n , Conserv. Biol. 16, 1457 (2002).\n [OpenUrl][9][CrossRef][10]\n\n# Response {#article-title-2}\n\nSwart suggests that direct payments are useful as a stop-gap measure when there is a need to change peoples' behavior radically and urgently but that, on the whole, we should rely on “sustainable, locally embedded approaches” to achieve conservation on a long-term basis. The appeal of self-financing conservation activities, which require outside investment only for a short time and then continue on their own steam to yield conservation and development benefits indefinitely, is obvious. Unfortunately, evidence of their existence is difficult to find. In some cases, the expected demand for the outputs fails to materialize; in other cases, demand becomes so great that it triggers nonsustainable exploitation or attracts competitors who can produce at lower cost by ignoring the conservation objectives. If the enterprises fail, the conservation link disappears (if there was one to begin with). In short, the “no pay, no care” dilemma is very real, but it applies to any conservation intervention. Biodiversity conservation is a public good, and, thus, one way or another, it must be subsidized because individuals will not voluntarily bear its cost on behalf of society at large. We believe that it makes practical and economic sense to subsidize conservation directly rather than indirectly.\n\nSwart argues that direct payments emphasize a vision of nature in which countable, measurable, and monetary aspects of nature dominate and that one should instead choose an approach that emphasizes the ethical, aesthetic, and spiritual motives for conservation. On the contrary, although direct payments may be in cash (or in kind), the motivations of those who provide payments are usually ethical, aesthetic, or spiritual. These motivations have certainly been strengthened by debate and education. We do not doubt that people who deplete biodiversity also have ethical, aesthetic, and spiritual values for nature. Biodiversity continues to be destroyed, however, because these noneconomic values have not been sufficiently robust to overcome economic forces. Debate and education cannot make these forces disappear. It is essential to counterbalance them by making it economically attractive (and feasible) for people to protect biodiversity instead of destroying it.\n\nSwart's argument that the use of payments would make nature a commodity like any other traded good or service misses the point that biodiversity is already a heavily traded commodity. It is an essential input into a variety of production activities such as fishing, logging, hunting, and agriculture. Unfortunately, local users can reap far greater economic rewards from depleting biodiversity than from conserving it. Biodiversity is being depleted for want of a better offer; payments will help rectify this problem.\n\nWe wholeheartedly agree with Swart that “conservation should be rooted in the life and mind of involved people to be successful in the long run.” However, we believe that such rooting is established through tangible incentives, not through wishful thinking that poor people in low-income nations will make substantial sacrifices in the short term for uncertain future rewards or for the benefit of the global community. Although direct payments are no “silver bullet,” they provide tangible incentives that can be flexibly and cost-efficiently linked to the protection of biodiversity in low-income nations. Given the lack of alternatives, we believe that direct payments for biodiversity conservation offer the best and most effective use of limited global conservation funds.\n\n [1]: /lookup/doi/10.1126/science.1078104\n [2]: #ref-1\n [3]: #ref-2\n [4]: #xref-ref-1-1 View reference 1 in text\n [5]: {openurl}?query=rft.jtitle%253DRestor.%2BEcol.%26rft.volume%253D9%26rft.spage%253D230%26rft.atitle%253DRESTOR%2BECOL%26rft_id%253Dinfo%253Adoi%252F10.1046%252Fj.1526-100x.2001.009002230.x%26rft.genre%253Darticle%26rft_val_fmt%253Dinfo%253Aofi%252Ffmt%253Akev%253Amtx%253Ajournal%26ctx_ver%253DZ39.88-2004%26url_ver%253DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%253Dinfo%253Aofi%252Ffmt%253Akev%253Amtx%253Actx\n [6]: /lookup/external-ref?access_num=10.1046/j.1526-100x.2001.009002230.x&link_type=DOI\n [7]: /lookup/external-ref?access_num=000169227600013&link_type=ISI\n [8]: #xref-ref-2-1 View reference 2 in text\n [9]: {openurl}?query=rft.jtitle%253DConserv.%2BBiol.%26rft.volume%253D16%26rft.spage%253D1457%26rft.atitle%253DCONSERV%2BBIOL%26rft_id%253Dinfo%253Adoi%252F10.1046%252Fj.1523-1739.2002.01668.x%26rft.genre%253Darticle%26rft_val_fmt%253Dinfo%253Aofi%252Ffmt%253Akev%253Amtx%253Ajournal%26ctx_ver%253DZ39.88-2004%26url_ver%253DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%253Dinfo%253Aofi%252Ffmt%253Akev%253Amtx%253Actx\n [10]: /lookup/external-ref?access_num=10.1046/j.1523-1739.2002.01668.x&link_type=DOI","citation":"Jac.

conservation or sustainable use of biological diversity presents special challenges for policy-makers because of its complex nature and the difficulties associated with identifying the underlying causes that lead to biodiversity loss. As such, it is often necessary that a range of incentive measures are utilised to ensure both the private and the public benefits of its conservation or sustainable use are realised. Incentive measures available for this purpose include economic incentives (such as taxes, charges, tradable use rights, and subsidies), regulatory measures (such as development or access restrictions), and the provision of relevant information and sufficient institutional capacity. While many of the direct use values of biodiversity are privately appropriable given a clear assignment of property rights and the existence of markets, other financing methods are often necessary for the realisation of other values, such as indirect use values, non-use values and option values. This paper expands the analysis in the Handbook of Incentive Measures for Biodiversity: Design and Implementation (OECD, 1999) developed under the responsibility of the OECD Expert Group on Economic Aspects of Biodiversity to discuss some of the methods available for financing incentive measures for the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity. Where appropriate, case studies of experiences in OECD countries are drawn upon to provide practical examples of the financing and implementation of incentive measures.","citation":"Helen Mountford & Jan Horst Keppler (1999)","page":1}

has been touted as a source of finance for biodiversity conservation. Recent work has suggested that the bioprospecting value of the \"marginal unit\" of genetic resources is likely to be vanishingly small, creating essentially no conservation incentive. This result is shown to flow specifically from a stylized description of the research process as one of brute-force testing, unaided by an organizing scientific framework. Neither the biological literature nor the behavior of industry actors lends clear support to the contention that natural products prospecting proceeds on the basis of randomized search. Scientific models channel research effort towards leads for which the expected productivity of discoveries is highest. Leads of unusual promise then command information rents, associated with their role in reducing the costs of search. When genetic materials are abundant, information rents are virtually unaffected by increases in the profitability of product discovery, and decline as technology improvements lower search costs. Numerical simulation results suggest that, under plausible conditions, the bioprospecting value of certain genetic resources could be large enough to support market-based conservation of biodiversity. The results call into question the conclusions of earlier analyses that had argued that biodiversity prospecting offers no hope as a meaningful source of finance for biodiversity conservation.","citation":"Gordon C.

of improved silvopastoral practices in degraded pasture areas is thought to provide valuable local and global environmental benefits, including biodiversity conservation, However, these practices are insufficiently attractive to individual land users for them to adopt them spontaneously, particularly due to their high initial costs. This paper describes the contract mechanism developed for the Regional Integrated Silvopastoral Ecosystem Management Project, which is being implemented with financing from the Global Environment Facility (GEF). The project is testing the use of the payment-for-service mechanism to encourage the adoption of silvopastoral practices in three countries of Central and South America: Colombia, Costa Rica, and Nicaragua. The project has created a mechanism that pays land users for the global environmental services they are generating, so that the additional income stream makes the proposed practices privately profitable. Designing the mechanism required addressing issues such as (1) measuring the actual amount of environmental services being provided, so that appropriate payments can be made; (2) providing payments in a way that resulted in the desired change in land use; and (3) avoiding the creation of perverse incentives (for example, for land users to cut down existing trees so as to qualify for additional payments for tree planting). Two variants of the proposed payment mechanism are being tested, with participating land users assigned randomly to one or the other. The project also includes extensive monitoring of the effectiveness of each mechanism in stimulating adoption of the proposed measures and of the resulting impact on environmental services and on household welfare. These features, together with the three-country approach, will provide in the coming years a very rich dataset for testing the use of contract mechanisms for biodiversity conservation.","citation":"Stefano Pagiola et al.

Caves are arguably the hottest of the biodiversity hotspots as measured by endemism and threat, yet they receive very little attention or appropriate management. Some recent investigations in China have found that up to 90% of the animals collected in caves are new to science, yet environmental assessments for development projects in karst areas rarely if ever give attention to the cave fauna. The lack of light, and the cave‐specific conditions of humidity, air flow and source of energy have resulted in extreme adaptations among the animals living within them. There is no government agency or non‐governmental organization (NGO) on conservation concerned with caves in China or many other countries, and although there are caving expeditions, they concentrate on exploration rather than the cave fauna. Disturbance by limestone quarrying, visitors, tourism infrastructure, and changes in water flow through, or from above, the cave can have devastating effects on the highly adapted and range‐restricted fauna. Some examples of World Bank‐financed development projects which have led to cave conservation are given. Synthesis and applications. The cave biodiversity of China and neighbouring countries is worthy of conservation and there is a huge number of nationally endemic species, most of which are unknown. Destruction or damage to caves can cause entire communities of cave species to become extinct. To address this problem, the disparate, taxon‐limited specialists interested in cave fauna need to reach out to the cave exploration community, the major conservation NGOs, and the state and local conservation agencies. Those charged with the task of conserving biodiversity should give thought to how the current national protected area systems and processes manage – and fail – to address the needs of the cave fauna, and look for the means to effect the necessary changes in management, based on the peculiar ecology of caves.","citation":"Tony Whitten (2009)","page":1}

Forest management practices have led to a reduction in the volume and a change in the composition of coarse woody debris (CWD) in many forest types. This study compared CWD volume and composition in reserves and two types of managed forest in the central boreal zone of Sweden. Ten areas were surveyed, each containing clear-cut, mature managed and old-growth stands, to determine the volume of standing and lying CWD in terms of species composition, decay class and size class. Volumes of CWD on clear-cuts and in mature managed forests were high compared with previous studies. Old-growth forests (72.6 m3 ha−1) contained a greater volume of CWD than mature managed forests (23.3 m3 ha−1) and clear-cuts (13.6 m3 ha−1). Differences were greatest for the larger size classes and intermediate decay stages. Despite stand ages being up to 144 years, CWD volume and composition in managed forests was more similar to clear-cuts than to old-growth forests.

We are grateful to the Kempe foundation for funding, and the forestry companies Holmen Skog AB, Sveaskog AB, Scaninge for stand information and use of sites within their forestry areas, to Fredrik Stenbacka for assistance with the fieldwork, and to our colleagues Barbara Ekbom and Thomas Ranius and two anonymous reviewers for comments on a draft of this manuscript.","citation":"Heloise Gibb et al.

issues surrounding 'Reduced Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation' (REDD) have become a major component of continuing negotiations under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). This paper aims to address two key requirements of any potential REDD mechanism: first, the generation of measurable, reportable and verifiable (MRV) REDD credits; and secondly, the sustainable and efficient provision of emission reductions under a robust financing regime.To ensure the supply of MRV credits, we advocate the establishment of an 'International Emission Reference Scenario Coordination Centre' (IERSCC). The IERSCC would act as a global clearing house for harmonized data to be used in implementing reference level methodologies. It would be tasked with the collection, reporting and subsequent processing of earth observation, deforestation- and degradation driver information in a globally consistent manner. The IERSCC would also assist, coordinate and supervise the computation of national reference scenarios according to rules negotiated under the UNFCCC. To overcome the threats of \"market flooding\" on the one hand and insufficient economic incentives for REDD on the other hand, we suggest an 'International Investment Reserve' (IIR) as REDD financing framework. In order to distribute the resources of the IIR we propose adopting an auctioning mechanism. Auctioning not only reveals the true emission reduction costs, but might also allow for incentivizing the protection of biodiversity and socio-economic values. The introduced concepts will be vital to ensure robustness, environmental integrity and economic efficiency of the future REDD mechanism.","citation":"Michael Obersteiner et al. (2009)","page":1}

agricultural research has historically been an example par excellence of open source approach to biological research. Beginning in the 1950s and especially in the 1960s, a looming global food crisis led to the development of a group of international agricultural research centers with a specific mandate to foster international exchange and crop improvement relevant to many countries. This formalization of a global biological commons in genetic resources was implemented through an elaborate system of international nurseries with a breeding hub, free sharing of germplasm, collaboration in information collection, the development of human resources, and an international collaborative network. This paper traces the history of the international wheat program with particular attention to how this truly open source system operated in practice and the impacts that it had on world poverty and hunger. The paper also highlights the challenges of maintaining and evolving such a system over the long term, both in terms of financing, as well the changing 'rules of the game' resulting from international agreements on intellectual property rights and biodiversity. Yet the open source approach is just as relevant today, as witnessed by current crises in food prices and looming crop diseases problem of global significance.","citation":"Derek Byerlee & H. J.

volume assesses how various institutional, policy and managerial options can enhance nature tourism's contribution to the triple bottom line. There are win-win outcomes but also trade offs between various policy objectives including: economic growth; poverty reduction; conservation finance/biodiversity conservation. This collaborative report highlights the complementarities and the trade-offs in promoting and managing sustainable nature tourism development and conservation. Nature tourism is important for many developing countries, including South Africa. If wisely managed, nature tourism offers valuable opportunities for generating revenues for development and for conservation. The recommendations are fairly specific to the Ezemvelo KwaZulu Natal Wildlife area. By combining various options into an integrated package to achieve economic development, equity and conservation, such a balanced approach provides pro-poor tourism opportunities for local communities, by reinvesting the proceeds in on-the-ground work in the reserves and in the community. It requires collaboration with private game reserves to drop fences and could contribute to a successful transformation of wildlife management to a nature tourism economy.","citation":"Bruce Aylward & E.

As the world approaches the 30-year anniversary of the Stockholm Conference on the Human Environment and prepares to review progress made in the decade since Dublin and Rio, we are confronted with results that are mostly disappointing. When it comes to addressing the water resources crisis, the 1990s may well be remembered as a decade of debate rather than action. Recent assessments suggest a doubling to almost two-thirds of the world's population experiencing some water stress by 2025 and increased demands to withdraw more water for a new \"green revolution\" for irrigated agriculture. Both of these will accelerate environmental degradation to a new crisis level while the existing degradation that resulted from the first \"green revolution\" still awaits remedial action both in the North as well as in the South. It is now clear that the global water crisis and the global environment crisis are linked and are being exacerbated by unprecedented global pressure resulting from over-consumption, population growth, globalization of economic systems and trade, reduction in development assistance, and failure to enact necessary policy, legal, and institutional reforms. This article makes the case that the traditional sector-by-sector approach to economic development is a key contributor to the two global crises. Lessons of experience are presented on policy, legal, and institutional reforms necessary to address the inter-linked crises through integrated approaches to managing land and water resources and their biological diversity. Water pricing reforms, reductions in damaging subsidies, land tenure reforms, community participation, and institutional reforms are necessary. There is a need to build upon the linkages and synergies among the three Rio conventions (climate, biodiversity, and desertification) in order to create new global driving forces for actions to address the crises holistically in the context of a country's national sustainable development strategy. The Global Environment Facility (GEF) and its implementing agencies stand ready with incremental cost grant financing to assist countries willing to undertake the reforms for integrated basin management of land, water and biological resources as they transition towards sustainable development","citation":"Alfred M.

and aid recipients acknowledge the importance of good governance for development. This understanding has spurred an intense interest in more refined, nuanced, and policy-relevant indicators of governance. In this paper we review progress to date in the area of measuring governance, using a simple framework of analysis focusing on two key questions: (i) what do we measure? and, (ii) whose views do we rely on? For the former question, we distinguish between indicators measuring formal laws or rules 'on the books', and indicators that measure the practical application or outcomes of these rules 'on the ground', calling attention to the strengths and weaknesses of both types of indicators as well as the complementarities between them. For the latter question, we distinguish between experts and survey respondents on whose views governance assessments are based, again highlighting their advantages, disadvantages, and complementarities. We also review the merits of aggregate as opposed to individual governance indicators. We conclude with some simple principles to guide the refinement of existing governance indicators and the development of future indicators. We emphasize the need to: transparently disclose and account for the margins of error in all indicators; draw from a diversity of indicators and exploit complementarities among them; submit all indicators to rigorous public and academic scrutiny; and, in light of the lessons of over a decade of existing indicators, to be realistic in the expectations of future indicators.

Part I reviews recent trends in the world economy and their implications for the future prospects of developing countries. Part II examines the role of public finance in development. This report includes the World Development Indicators, which provide selected social and economic indicators for more than 100 countries. Despite continued economic growth through 1987 and into 1988, two problems have characterized recent trends: unsustainable economic imbalances within and among industrial countries, and highly uneven economic growth among developing countries. Part I of the report concludes that three interdependent policy challenges need to be addressed. First, industrial countries need to reduce their external payments imbalances. Second, developing countries need to continue restructuring their domestic economic policies in order to gain creditworthiness and growth. Third, net resource transfers, external debt, from the developing countries must be trimmed so that investment and growth can resume. Part II of the report explores how public finance policies are best designed and implemented. How deficits are reduced is crucial: controlling costs in mobilizing revenues and setting careful priorities in public spending are equally important. Efficiency in providing public services and expanding the scope for raising revenue can be achieved through decentralizing decisionmaking and reforming state-owned enterprises with the latter permitting greater private participation.

public is expressing increasing interest in obtaining wildlife habitat, biodiversity, and other values from forests. However, landowners and land managers presently receive no compensation for providing these values. While the resulting dilemma is often characterized as a [open quotes]preservation versus timber-harvest[close quotes] tradeoff, several management options could contribute to both economic and other goals. Although many gradations exist, two primary approaches exist to provide wildlife habitat, biodiversity, and other ecological values: the [open quotes]natural reserves[close quotes] approach and the [open quotes]landscape management[close quotes] approach. Natural reserves approach could result in substitution of such as steel, aluminum, concrete, and plastics for wood, all of which are not only non-renewable but much more fossil fuel intensive. This article primarily presents the landscape management approach including benefits (biodiversity, reduction in CO2 emissions, increasing supply, etc.) and financing options (timber excise tax, capital gains tax, carbon sequestration swaps, etc.). 10 refs., 1 fig.","citation":"Bruce Lippke & Chadwick Dearing Oliver (1993)","page":1}

The World Summit on Sustainable Development (WSSD) was held in Johannesburg in 2002 to review progress since the Rio conference in 1992, and to agree a new global deal on sustainable development. Unlike its predecessor, it was primarily concerned with implementation rather than with new treaties and targets, although a number of new targets were agreed, for example one on sanitation. Failure to agree a target on renewable energy was regarded as a major disappointment of the conference. While relatively modest in its achievements, and with difficulties in achieving consensus in key areas such as energy, trade, finance and globalisation, WSSD nevertheless succeeded in placing sustainable development back on the political agenda, giving new impetus, in particular to the environment and development needs of Africa, with a strong focus on local issues like household energy, water and sanitation. Health was singled out as one of five priority areas, along with water, energy, agriculture and biodiversity, and was devoted a separate chapter in the resulting Plan of Implementation, which highlighted a range of environmental health issues as well as issues relating to health services, communicable and non-communicable diseases. A number of new partnerships were formed at WSSD, including the Healthy Environments for Children Alliance (HECA) launched by WHO, which will form an important platform for implementation. The Commission on Sustainable Development has been designated main responsibility for monitoring and follow up, with its programme of work reorganised to focus on thematic clusters of issues. From the perspective of health, WSSD must be seen as a reaffirmation of the central place of health on the sustainable development agenda, and in the broader context of a process which began in Rio and was given added impetus with the Monterrey Financing for Development conference and the World Trade Organisation meeting held in Doha. Translating policies into action at all levels- global to local – remains the single biggest challenge in the years that lie ahead.","citation":"Yasmin von Schirnding (2005)","page":1}

nature conservation, but also the expansion of genetic engineering and the intrusion of industrial interests into areas from which they had been hitherto excluded. These elements have participated in the development of utilitarian perceptions of nature, reduced to a set of resources thanks to new technologies that have made its extensive economic exploitation possible. The Convention on Biological Diversity, adopted in 1992 during the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro, is in line with this approach (UNEP 1992). Indeed, the Convention rests on the notion of sustainable use of biological resources (first article), that is, an exploitation that meets the criteria of efficiency and equity and is meant to finance conservation but also to foster development in countries of the South and to benefit pharmaceutical and agricultural industries. The Convention presents the definition of adequate property rights to biological resources and related knowledge as an essential prerequisite for the institution of the sustainable use—hence of the conservation—of biodiversity. This analysis comes to adhere implicitly to the conventional view of biodiversity erosion as a consequence of the appropriation failure that prevailed prior to the adoption of the Convention. Transnational corporations then had free access to indigenous resources—including knowledge—and after screening they could patent parts of these resources or their applications, depriving their former holders of their traditional use rights, as attested by the examples of neem in India or yellow bean in Mexico, both patented by American","citation":"Valérie Boisvert & Armelle Caron (2002)","page":1}

The World Development Report 1992 explores the links between economic development and the environment. The 1990 report on poverty, last year's report on development strategies, and this report constitute a trilogy on the goals and means of development. The main message of this year's report is the need to integrate environmental considerations into development policymaking. The report argues that continued, and even accelerated, economic and human development is sustainable and can be consistent with improving environmental conditions, but that this will require major policy, program, and institutional shifts. A twofold strategy is required. First, the positive links between efficient income growth and the environment need to be aggressively exploited. Second, strong policies and institutions need to be put in place which cause decision makers to adopt less damaging forms of behavior. Where tradeoffs exist between income growth and environmental quality, the report argues for a careful assessment of the costs and benefits of alternative policies. This approach will result in much less environmental damage. Like its predecessors, this report includes the World Development Indicators, which offer selected social and economic statistics on 125 countries.

As a result, the pace of new connections to electricity, water, and sanitation services increased by more than 40 percent. Moreover, households in traditionally excluded sectors—the poor, rural, and indigenous populations—were twice as likely to be the beneficiaries of a new infrastructure connection than they had been prior to the Peace Accords. The teledensity index increased by a factor of five from 4.2 in 1997 to 19.7 in 2001, largely because of the growth in cellular telephones, which now outnumber fixed lines. The number of public telephones in rural areas increased by 80 percent since the Peace Accords, so that 80 percent of rural households are now within six kilometers from a public telephone. Although real electricity tariffs increased by 60–80 percent following the reform, residential consumers have been shielded by a \"social tariff\" policy that has kept charges at pre-reform levels. This policy, which costs US$50 million a year, does little to benefit poor households. The reason is that 60 percent of poor households are not connected to the electricity network, and those that are consume modest amounts of electricity and hence capture only 10 percent of the total value of the subsidy. In contrast, poor households without access to electricity pay about US$11 a kilowatt-hour (or 80 times the electricity tariff) to light their homes with candles and wick lamps. The resources used to finance the \"social tariff\" would therefore be better used in further accelerating the pace of new connections for currently underserved households. This paper—a product of the Finance Private Sector, and Infrastructure Unit, Latin America and the Caribbean Region—is part of a larger effort in the region to understand the social impacts of infrastructure reform.

‘carbon-offsetting' projects are widely seen as the ideal solution to three equally challenging problems of the 21st century: climate change, biodiversity conservation and socio-economic development. Hopes are being pinned on the potential of Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation (REDD) schemes, which after 2012 will represent the most likely route for bringing the currently excluded community forests into official climate change mitigation. However, not everyone is convinced of their potential, and some point instead to the challenges involved in ensuring both environmental gains and livelihood benefits. This paper provides a background to carbon financing involving forestry, focusing on community forestry in the global South. It goes on to review a number of questions and challenges which affect the potential efficiency and equity of ‘carbon forestry'. Finally, it considers these issues with regard to community forestry in Nepal, arguing that they must be addressed in future policy or project development in the country. Key words: carbon financing, community forestry, REDD, biodiversity conservation, livelihoods Full text is available at the ForestAction website Journal of Forest and Livelihood 8(1) February 2009 pp.25-32","citation":"Samantha Staddon (2009)","page":1}

approaches to environmental management are all the rage. Claims that market mechanisms can encourage environmental protection and promote greater economic efficiency while saving taxpayers' money are tantalizing. In the forestry sector, policy makers are widely heeding this advice and shrinking command–and–control systems in favour of incentive mechanisms that seek to align private enthusiasm with the public good. In some cases, governments are even promoting the creation of markets where none existed before. In others, markets are evolving of their own accord. In such times of change, it is difficult to stand back and take stock. Yet, it is during such times that guidance is most needed. In the rush to introduce market–based solutions to environmental problems, a particular concern is how markets are impacting on the poor.In this paper an effort is made to draw on a recent review of markets for four forest environmental services (biodiversity conservation, carbon sequestration, watershed protection and landscape beauty) to draw out preliminary insights into how markets are performing with respect to their impacts on the poor. The evidence suggests a need for caution. While the potential benefits are significant, the poor face an uphill battle in realizing them. Key constraints facing the poor include a lack of property rights over forest resources and their environmental services; inadequate skills and education; poor market information; lack of market contacts; inadequate communication infrastructure; inappropriate contract design; and lack of access to financial resources. To tackle these, four potential ways forward are highlighted:(1) assign property rights to forest assets and their related environmental services in ways that respect customary arrangements and poor people's tenure;(2) strengthen capacity for market participation, e.g. through training and education;(3) invest in the provision of market information, advice and, essentially, a contact point for buyers and sellers, perhaps through the establishment of a 'market support centre'; and(4) improve access to finance so that poor individuals can make necessary up–front investments in market participation.","citation":"Natasha Landell-Mills (2002)","page":1}

increases in prices of staple foods raise the real incomes of those selling food, many of whom are relatively poor, while hurting net food consumers, many of whom are also relatively poor. The impacts on poverty will certainly be very diverse, but the average impact on poverty depends upon the balance between these two effects, and can only be determined by looking at real-world data. Results using household data for ten observations on nine low-income countries show that the short-run impacts of higher staple food prices on poverty differ considerably by commodity and by country, but, that poverty increases are much more frequent, and larger, than poverty reductions. The recent large increases in food prices appear likely to raise overall poverty in low income countries substantially.

Many endangered species depend on certain types of agricultural or other forms of human land use. To conserve such species, schemes are set up in which land users receive payments for voluntarily managing their land in a biodiversity‐enhancing manner. We developed a model‐based framework for designing cost‐effective payment schemes that generate spatiotemporal habitat heterogeneity to maximize the survival of multiple species under budget constraints. The framework integrates ecological and economic knowledge and consists of the derivation of an ecological benefit function and a budget function that are then combined to determine the cost‐effective degree of spatiotemporal habitat heterogeneity. The ecological benefit function considers the timing of conservation measures, the induced habitat dynamics, and different degrees of substitutability among species. The budget function considers that the conservation agency may lack information about land users’ individual conservation costs and personal attitudes and that land users can choose among different conservation measures. We applied the framework to a case study of grassland management, where the survival of three endangered species protected by the EU Habitats Directive depends on different types of land use. The lack of information available to the agency and the choice options of land users reduced the amount of conservation that can be financed with a given budget. Neglecting such findings may lead to an overestimation of the benefits of conservation programs.","citation":"Martin Drechsler et al. (2007)","page":1}

to a growing interest in biodiversity issues, plant ecology research in Brazil in the past decades has predominantly aimed to produce descriptive accounts of vegetation structure, floristics and phytosociology. However, following the tradition of the notable Brazilian ecologists of the 40's and 50's, several studies conducted by a distinctive group of young Brazilian researchers were characteristically concerned with the relationship between plants and theirs physical and chemical environment. Thus, the main purpose of this volume is to review the bulk of achievements of this group of functional ecologists in order to call the attention of our expressive new generation of plant ecologists to functional and adaptive mechanisms related to plant survival and growth in environments subjected to seasonal drought or flooding. Therefore, the reviews were grouped under two sections, namely Xerophytic Plants and Amphibious Plants . The reviews altogether quote over 700 references gathering tropical examples of plant life strategies, contemporary theoretical issues related to stress ecophysiology, and modern techniques for measuring and assessing plant fitness, survival and productivity. Despite all this effort there are many gaps still to be filled. We hope this volume will contribute to point out directions for future research. We are indebted to the Brazilian Botanical Society (SBB) who let us organize the Ecophysiology Symposium in the XLVII Congresso Nacional de Botânica (22, 23/vi/1996), where these reviews were presented. CNPq, RHAE/Meio Ambiente ans SBBB financed the trip of the invited researchers. The Post-Graduate Program in Ecology of Federal University of Rio de Janeiro allocated funds for the edition of this volume. We are particularly thankful to the reviewers, whose comments improved the quality of the present reviews; and to Prof. Dorothy Sue Dunn de Araujo who patiently improved the English language used in all chapters. Considering that one of the main goals of the series Oecologia Brasiliensis is to attend the demand for literature of the vast number of Brazilian students of Ecology and that the three previous volumes were issued in Portuguese, it is worth to mention that the present volume was written in English for two reasons. The main reason is that the reduced number of Brazilian specialist on the theme dealt with here required the review of the articles were done by foreign researchers; secondly, we believe that in such manner we contribute to launch the series beyond our geographical borders.

conservation outcomes are closely related to the rules and institutions governing resource use. Creating local incentives for conservation through more secure resource tenure is central to conservation outcomes on private and communal lands, where the preponderance of biodiversity occurs. Conservation efforts in sub-Saharan Africa are therefore centrally concerned with governance dynamics and institutional reform processes, such as the decentralization of property rights, and how best to achieve such reforms. Traditional mechanisms for financing conservation efforts in Africa rely heavily on funds channeled through multilateral and bilateral aid agencies. The history of development aid highlights a range of constraints these aid agencies face in terms of working toward more effective resource governance arrangements and promoting reforms. Government aid agencies possess incentives for promoting large-scale and short-term projects that maximize expenditure volumes and tend to define issues in technical rather than political terms. The history of development aid suggests that these and other characteristics of aid agencies impedes their ability to influence governance reform processes and that aid funding may discourage the adoption of reforms. Greater emphasis in African conservation financing needs to be placed on flexible, small-scale investments aligned to local interests and constituencies that prioritize innovation, learning, and experimentation. Additionally, more research is required that explores the linkages between conservation funding, donor decision-making processes, and governance reforms.","citation":"Fred Nelson (2009)","page":1}

parks in developing countries are home to the planet's most undervalued natural assets. Positive experience with public-private partnerships in nature conservation in Africa shows that they can improve service through professional management and marketing, reduce the need for public subsidies, and mobilize capital for investment in park infrastructure and biodiversity. The best choice of structure for such partnerships depends mainly on the capacity of the incumbent public park agency. Within a national system of protected areas a diversified funding strategy makes it possible to focus public resources on the protected areas that cannot be self-financing but are critical to achieving the system's biodiversity objectives.","citation":"Nicola Ruggero Saporiti (2006)","page":1}

parks in developing countries are home to the planet's most undervalued natural assets. Positive experience with public-private partnerships in nature conservation in Africa shows that they can improve service through professional management and marketing, reduce the need for public subsidies, and mobilize capital for investment in park infrastructure and biodiversity. The best choice of structure for such partnerships depends mainly on the capacity of the incumbent public park agency. Within a national system of protected areas a diversified funding strategy makes it possible to focus public resources on the protected areas that cannot be self-financing but are critical to achieving the system's biodiversity objectives.","citation":"Nico Saporiti (2006)","page":1}

A conservation scheme for local poultry breeds from the Veneto region (Italy), the Co.Va. (Conservazione e Valorizzazione di Razze Avicole Locali Venete - Conservation and valorisation of local poultry genetic resources of Veneto region) project began in 2000 with finance provided by the Veneto Region. This project involved four organic farms located in different areas (mountain, hill and plain) in the region. The local chicken breeds included in the project were the Robusta Maculata, Robusta Lionata, Ermellinata di Rovigo, Pépoi and Padovana; the local duck breeds were the Germana Veneta and Mignon; the local turkey breeds were the Bronzato Comune and Ermellinato di Rovigo; and the local guinea fowl breed was the Camosciata. All breeds are dual-purpose breeds and are utilized for meat and egg production. The Department of Animal Science of the University of Padova planned a marker-assisted conservation scheme based on the maintenance and multiplication of these breeds within their production system (in situ conservation scheme). The objectives of the farmers involved in this project were to use these genotypes to generate typical regional products for local markets, to support the development of economically marginal areas through the revaluation of local breeds and to allow the preservation of animal biodiversity.","citation":"Massimo De Marchi et al.

exurban, and rural development in the United States consumes nearly 1 million hectares of land per year and is a leading threat to biodiversity. In response to this threat, conservation development has been advanced as a way to combine land development and land conservation while providing functional protection for natural resources. Yet, although conservation development techniques have been in use for decades, there have been few critical evaluations of their conservation effectiveness. We addressed this deficiency by assessing the conservation outcomes of one type of conservation development project: conservation and limited development projects (CLDPs). Conducted by land trusts, landowners, and developers, CLDPs use revenue from limited development to finance the protection of land and natural resources. We compared a sample of 10 CLDPs from the eastern United States with their respective baseline scenarios (conventional development) and with a sample of conservation subdivisions--a different conservation development technique characterized by higher-density development. To measure conservation success, we created an evaluation method containing eight indicators that quantify project impacts to terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems at the site and in the surrounding landscape. The CLDPs protected and managed threatened natural resources including rare species and ecological communities. In terms of conservation benefits, the CLDPs significantly outperformed their respective baseline scenarios and the conservation subdivisions. These results imply that CLDPs can offer a low-impact alternative to conventional development and a low-cost method for protecting land when conventional conservation techniques are too expensive. In addition, our evaluation method demonstrates how planners and developers can incorporate appropriate ecological considerations when designing, reviewing, and evaluating conservation development projects.","citation":"Jeffrey C.

carbon market recently appeared as a new way to finance conservation programs in Madagascar. Based on an analysis of a pioneer carbon sequestration project co-financed by the Biocarbon Fund of the World Bank, I contend in this article that this new approach will fail to contribute to the protection of Malagasy biodiversity. A first argument is that carbon projects will inherit rural development practices and discourses that did not lead to successful agricultural intensification until now. For this reason, they will fail to compensate farmers for the land lost by reforestation. A second argument is that the potential profits generated by carbon sale provide a supplementary motive for the appropriation of resources by the state and other actors, to the detriment of local communities. I conclude that in order to make carbon sequestration an effective tool for conservation, it is necessary to implement successful agricultural development activities, to guarantee the use rights of local communities, and to channel to them the most significant part of the carbon profits. This last strategy should not be regarded as a payment for environmental service.

methods often are focused on preserving the biodiversity of a particular landscape or ecosystem. Scientists frequently employ species richness as an indicator of biodiversity. However, species richness data are problematic when attempts are made to enumerate microfungi, particularly those from the soil. Many soil fungi fail to sporulate, making identification difficult. Other means of assessing the importance of fungi to ecosystem preservation must be developed. Otherwise, microfungi might be overlooked in discussions of ecosystem management and conservation issues. Herein, we have described a procedure (Soil FungiLog) and analytical techniques that will let investigators examine the functional role that soil fungi play in providing structure and stability to ecosystems. Ecosystem function in many cases might be more important than species diversity in gaining an understanding of ecosystem dynamics. Functional attributes are critical for maintaining ecosystem structure and stability. The preservation of the functions associated with the extant biota, particularly from soil microbes, might be just as important as species diversity in the conservation of ecosystems and biodiversity. The Soil FungiLog procedure was used to assess functional diversity of soil fungi in a Georgia forest disturbed by human activity and along an elevational gradient in the Chihuahuan Desert. Sites within each location were separated on the basis of fungal carbon substrate utilization profiles. These profiles were analyzed to provide information regarding the functional diversity of soil fungal assemblages at each site. The effects of disturbance and elevation were evaluated with respect to soil fungal functional diversity.KeywordsBiologdiscriminant function analysisfunctional diversityFungiLogsoil fungi The authors gratefully acknowledge Richard E.

A brief overview is given of nematode taxonomy since its beginnings in the second half of the 19th century. Most of the work concerned α-taxonomy, but in the thirties and subsequently from the sixties several classifications have been proposed. Since the eighties phylogenetic systematics was introduced as the underlying theory. Due to the pioneering work of several famous nematode taxonomists in the first half of the 20th century an increased interest for the discipline arose. Very unfortunately, this interest decreased in more recent times to an alarming extent. The difficulty to correctly identify and to describe the rapidly increasing numbers of taxa has discouraged many young scientists and diverted them toward more appealing disciplines. Taxonomy provides nevertheless the basic knowledge for studies on biodiversity as well as for analyses of ecological and phylogenetic relationships. Molecular techniques have made systematics again exciting; when combined with the more traditional morphological approach, they will lead to new insights. Hopefully, these will arouse the interest of young scientists. Even then the future of nematode taxonomy will depend on the funding opportunities provided by national and international authorities. La systématique des nématodes est brièvement revue depuis ses origines dans la seconde moitié du 19ème siècle. La plupart des travaux sont relatifs l’ α-taxinomie, mais dans les années trente et ensuite dans les années soixante, plusieurs classifications ont été proposées. Depuis les années 80, la systématique phylogénétique a été introduite comme la théorie sous-jacente. Grâce au travail de pionnier de plusieurs taxinomistes célèbres dans la première moitié du 20ème siècle, un intérêt accru est apparu pour la discipline. Très malheureusement, cet intérêt a décru récemment jusqu’à un niveau alarmant. La difficulté d’identifier correctement et de décrire un nombre de taxons augmentant rapidement a découragé de nombreux jeunes scientifiques et les a poussé vers des disciplines plus attirantes. La taxinomie cependant apporte la connaissance de base tant pour des études de biodiversité que pour des études de relations écologiques et phylogénétiques. Les techniques moléculaires ont rendu la systématique à nouveau attractive; lorsqu’elles seront combinées avec l’approche morphologique plus traditionnelle, elles conduiront à de nouveaux développements. Heureusement, elles vont réveiller l’intérêt des jeunes chercheurs. Malgré cela, le futur de la taxinomie des nématodes dépendra des opportunités de financement par les autorités nationales et internationales.","citation":"A. Coomans (2000)","page":1}

comprehensive international management effectiveness evaluation (MEE) of the Finnish protected area system was commissioned by the Metsahallitus Natural Heritage Services (NHS) in 2004. The evaluation was conducted in the IUCN World Commission on Protected Areas (WCPA) framework, but was adapted to the conditions of Finland. The elements of the management cycle considered were context, planning, resources, process, outputs and outcomes. The evaluation team reviewed literature and the NHS conducted a rapid selfassessment on 70 protected areas. Drawing on these, the team developed a series of specific questions based on the WCPA framework. The questions were answered by the NHS and they formed the core of the assessment and the subsequent report. The MEE was finalised by a field assessment, which included visits to representative protected area sites as well as meetings with NHS staff and representatives of directing and financing ministries, local stakeholder groups and NGOs. The evaluation gives the general rating that Finland’s protected areas are well managed, and with some exceptions, they appear to be achieving their aims of conserving biodiversity. However, the evaluators give a number of recommendations for improvements, summed up into ten areas of suggested action. Ecosystem approach in planning is suggested to integrate protected areas with the land and water mosaics surrounding them to form effective ecological networks. Regional landscape plans for conservation should involve innovative partnerships with private land owners, local communities and other state land managers. System planning is recommended to be supported by national strategies addressing invasive species and climate change. In addition a gap analysis of threatened species is suggested to see whether current conservation actions are adequate. Site planning for management is falling behind schedule; strategic targets and milestones are required to finish and update this process. Periodical risk assessment would help to focus planning on sites in greatest need of action. Conservation outcomes should be emphasized in management of protected areas. Certain declining habitats deserve greater attention. More areas where hunting and fishing is prohibited are needed as are efforts to reduce impacts of overgrazing by reindeer in the far north. Community outcomes: specific efforts should be made to poll opinions and build arguments for protection with rural local communities to reduce still continuing antipathy for protected areas. Visitor outcomes: visitor impacts should be assessed and impact reduction looked into by raising public awareness of service costs and environmental effects. Financing provided by the Finnish government is in general seen adequate in international comparison. Exploration of options for other kinds of support are recommended. Annual audits should check against delivery on objectives, especially on those related to conservation. Global role of Finland’s protected areas and the significance of conservation work was seen not fully to be comprehended by all NHS staff. Better understanding of the Convention of Biological Diversity and Natura 2000 targets was suggested as a potentially motivating factor for staff. Assessment of cultural values requires a strategy. Terrestrial and underwater habitat inventories are to continue. A Natura 2000 master plan for monitoring is needed. Assessment and monitoring systems should be worked into a coherent framework and resources concentrated on a suite of key indicators to sum up biodiversity and cultural outcomes in protected areas. State of the Parks reporting is recommended on a regular five-year basis to analyse and communicate management effectiveness and support a culture of adaptive management. Reporting should involve external review.","citation":"Brian Gilligan et al. (2005)","page":1}

Global Economic Prospects 2007 analyzes the opportunities - and stresses - this will create. While rich and poor countries alike stand to benefit, the integration process will make more acute stresses already apparent today - in income inequality, in labor markets, and in the environment. Over the next 25 years, rapid technological progress, burgeoning trade in goods and services, and integration of financial markets create the opportunity for faster long-term growth. However, some regions, notably Africa, are at risk of being left behind. The coming globalization will also see intensified stresses on the \"global commons\". Addressing global warming, preserving marine fisheries, and containing infectious diseases will require effective multilateral collaboration to ensure that economic growth and poverty reduction proceed without causing irreparable harm to future generations.

Abstract:Developing countries are facing major challenges to their rural land use, including deforestation, increasing scarcity of tree products, and environmental degradation on fragile agricultural lands. One of the ways they have responded to these problems is by promoting \" agroforestry, \" or on-farm tree establishment and management. Public agencies, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) and international donors have supported agroforestry development efforts and are considering further substantial investments. But agroforestry activities have been poorly documented and project monitoring has been weak or nonexistent or has addressed administrative concerns only. To answer the need for hard data, an analysis of the costs, benefits, and farmer adoption of agroforestry was undertaken. This was the first large-scale study of farm-level profitability of agroforestry in the tropics and involved empirical work for twenty-one projects in Central America and the Caribbean.

study examines the market for and business characteristics of ecolodges operating in developing countries, in order to determine the key factors for business viability of ecolodges. The study also includes a review of how these facilities can have a positive impact on the environment and maximize their sustainable development benefits for their regions and local communities. After a brief introduction in Section 1, Section 2 looks at the ecolodge marketplace, including the demographics of ecotourists, their activity and accommodation preferences, and the global trends that influence the ecotourism market and demand for ecolodges. Section 3 provides a brief review of the evolving policy and enabling environment policy and enabling environment for ecotourism around the world. Section 4 presents a discussion of how ecolodges can become financially viable, with a summary of the basic ecolodge business and finance model, an analysis of the key factors for profitability for ecolodges, and an assessment of the main technical assistance needs of ecolodge owners and managers. Section 5 examines potential positive and negative biodiversity impacts of ecolodges. Finally, Section 6 presents a brief conclusion assessing the future of the ecolodge market.","citation":"Ifc (2004)","page":1}

Half of all terrestrial species can be found in the 6% of the world’s land area covered by tropical forests, and these species face the gravest risk. In developing tropical countries, the social agenda is dominated by the pressing needs of poor and growing populations. Despite the difficulties inherent in influencing behavior in other countries, international efforts to preserve biodiversity have been under way for many years. Aggregate statistics are difficult to come by, but some numbers are indicative of the commitment. The World Bank has dedicated well over a billion dollars toward biodiversity conservation. A number of donors have allocated the same amount toward retiring developing country debt under debt-for-nature swaps. A recent study of conservation spending in Latin America reported approximately $3.3 billion in expenditures. Private foundations have contributed more than $10 million per year to conservation in developing countries. Over the past two decades, conservation funding has shifted away from the “parks and fences” approach toward one attempting to integrate conservation and development projects. This new approach has been harshly criticized. “Integrated conservation and development projects,” as they are called, have been labeled as little more than wishful, and generally ineffectual, thinking in works such as John Terborgh’s Requiem for Nature (Island Press, 1999). Calls to return to a parks and fences approach have sparked another backlash from critics who regard it as little better than stealing indigenous peoples’ land at gunpoint. While these debates are raging, other groups are cataloguing, extolling, or sometimes lambasting a variety of innovative approaches to conservation finance. The conservation need is urgent, the stakes are high, and the debate is heated. There has never been a greater need for both a clear understanding of the principles involved and a careful investigation of the facts.","citation":"Paul J. Ferraro & R.

to the world's population over the next 50 years and 2.8 billion people today already live on less than $2 a day-almost all in developing countries. Ensuring these people have access to productive work and a better quality of life is the core development challenge of the first half of this century. Growth could itself be jeopardized over the longer term, unless a transformation of society and the management of the environment are addressed integrally with economic growth. Now in its 25th edition, this year's World Development Report examines, over a 50 year period, the relationship between competing policy objectives of reducing poverty, maintaining growth, improving social cohesion, and protecting the environment. The World Development Report 2003 emphasizes that many good policies have been identified but not implemented due to distributional issues and barriers to developing better institutions. The Report reviews institutional innovations that might help overcome these barriers and stresses that ensuring economic growth and improved management of the planet's ecosystem requires a reduction in poverty and inequality at all levels: local, national, and international. As in previous years, the report contains an appendix of selected indicators from the World Development Indicators.

report describes the findings of an assessment of GEF-financed enabling activity projects for biodiversity conservation. These projects are mainly assisting recipient countries (1) to develop national biodiversity strategies and action plans as required by Article 6 of the Convention on Biological Diversity (the Convention) and (2) to complete their first national reports to the Conference of the Parties (COP) of the Convention. The progress made towards completing national biodiversity planning efforts varies significantly. Some countries have moved fairly quickly and, by early 1999, were about to finalize impressive national biodiversity strategies and action plans, based on in-depth consultations with key stakeholders, solid technical analysis of major issues, and careful development of a plan consisting of clearly defined and prioritized activities. In contrast, other countries have experienced significant start up delays, have not managed to consult widely, and seem to be developing action plans consisting mainly of projects requiring international funding. Very few countries have started implementing their action plans. The report notes that although notable and significant progress in biodiversity planning has indeed been made by many countries implementing enabling activities, the development and implementation of national biodiversity plans that can make a real difference to current rates of biodiversity loss, and the commitment and capacity to implement such plans, are still some way in the future. Thus, continued follow-up action by the countries and the Global Environment Facility is critical.","citation":"Michael Wells et al. (1999)","page":1}

Social tariff schemes of various kinds are already widespread in Latin America, but they suffer from a number of design flaws. Increasing block tariff (IBT) structures are the most prevalent form of social tariffs in the region. These are likely to be more successful in the electricity sector than in the water sector because the correlation between consumption and income is much stronger in the case of electricity than water. Moreover, IBT structures in electricity tend to be much better designed than in the case of water, with lower fixed charges, lower subsistence blocks, and steeper gradients. A number of more sophisticated social tariff schemes are also being applied that combine consumption criteria with some form of socioeconomic screening. These are generally found to perform better than IBTs, although they also present significant room for improvement.

The author goes on to develop an original analytical treatment of the incremental cost financing mechanisms adopted by the Convention on Biological Diversity. Significantly, he undertakes a microeconomic study of land use change in a biosphere reserve in South-East Mexico. Based on an original data set, the author presents a detailed modelling exercise of resource and land use choices at the individual farm level with related projections of the impact at both community and regional levels. Techniques used include multi-period linear programming and dynamic stock-flow simulation. The book concludes by addressing policy implications and options for future research.","citation":"Raffaello Cervigni (2001)","page":1}

value biodiversity found in tropical rain forests for a variety of utilitarian, aesthetic, moral, ecological, and socioeconomic reasons (Botkin and Talbot, 1992). For instance, traditional medicines derived from plant and animal species found in the tropics provide health services to rural and urban populations; about 25 percent of the pharmaceutical products produced in the United States are associated with plants (WRI et al., 1992). Genetic materials extracted from plant and animal species have contributed to the development of commercial agricultural products (e.g., new varieties of wheat, maize, and rice) that are more resistant to pests and diseases. And nature tourism, often associated with protected wildlife habitats, has become an important source of income, generating about $ 12 billion annually in worldwide earnings (Lindberg, 1991). There are important socioeconomic and political considerations in the valuation of biological resources and the protection of biodiversity. First, the benefits that result from biodiversity have spatial and temporal dimensions. The ecological services linked with biodiversity, such as clean air and water, and the use of genetic material and ingredients extracted from plants, animals, and microorganisms, occur at different places and at different times, often beyond the “economic time scale” of individuals. Second, biodiversity has characteristics of a public good locally arid nationally and may be considered a “global environmental good” in an international context. The benefits of public goods flow to all people regardless of whether they have paid for the good, which means that public goods suffer from the problem of “free riders.” In a national context, economists have long focused attention on the difficulty of financing public goods and have generally concluded that such goods will be underprovided by markets. In the international context, the provision and financing of public goods is even more problematic. These characteristics make management of biodiversity institutionally complex and create problems in defining property rights. Third, conservation of biodiversity can create significant nonuse values. By its very existence, biodiversity can generate economic value without requiring actual use and can provide value by leaving open the option of future use.","citation":"Randall A.

conservation or protection is a kind of socioeconomic activity with positive externality.To internalize the externality,the concept of Ecological Compensation (EC) is put forward.It adopts economic and market-based instruments to encourage people participate in ecological conservation.Participant Gets Principle (PGP) and Beneficiary Pays Principle (BPP) are the two basic principles of it.EC has been widely applied to afforestation,watershed management,agro-environmental protection,biodiversity conservation,carbon sequestration,and so on.While its theories and practices are still in infancy,the compensation system is imperfect with respect to who should be compensated,who should pay,how much to be compensated,and how to finance and allocate compensation payments.By reviewing EC approaches and some efforts that have been made in developed countries (e.g. America and some European countries) and developing countries (e.g. China and Latin American countries),we find out there was very little use of the BPP,ecology and economics have not been well integrated into EC studies,most programs just focus on payments,ignoring the influence of socioeconomic factors on ecological conservation,and so on.After the review and comments,we summarize a functioning mechanism of ecological compensation,which can guide us to improve ecological compensation system.The improvement methods concern:(a)identifying providers and beneficiaries of ecosystem services; (b)on the basis of opportunity cost approach,integrating ecological conservation with regional socioeconomic development,settling proper compensation standards to services providers;(c)calculating payment levels from the side of beneficiaries by integrating the quantity of services they receive,their willingness to pay and their bearing capacity;(d)seeking financing sources and allocating payments cost-effectively;and(e)building up the framework of EC.We consider an effective EC system should take “hematogenesis” rather than “blood transfusion” as its object,and EC research should integrate ecological theories and methods with those of economics.","citation":"Muyi Kang (2007)","page":1}

real options approach considers strategic management and decision-making as a process aimed at actively reducing exposition to downside risk and promoting exposition to upside opportunities. It stands at the hinge between pure finance and other areas of decision making under risk such as project evaluation, market entry and exit, organizational restructuring and re-engineering, technology adoption, climate change and biodiversity decisions, etc. The approach underlines a frame of mind and uses methodologies that appeal to a wide array of managers, thus providing a common language. Real options have applications in many areas that are central to modern corporations: market coverage and development, finance, human resources management, technology management, R&D and knowledge management, etc. Thinking in terms of real options represents a major development in strategic but remains relatively unknown in spite of its adoption by firms such as Airbus, GE, Hewlett Packard, Intel, Toshiba and others. Nonetheless, as shown in the academic literature and as argued in some of the quotes below, the contribution of higher level managers to the value of a firm lies in the creation and the exercise of real options. Indeed the value of strategic management itself can be assessed that way. At a more macroeconomic level, the efficiency of financial systems rests primarily on proper risk assessment and management in project evaluation. The real options approach is the crucial analytical tool to fulfill such a need and act as a link between the financial and the real sectors. Lorsqu'on applique une approche options reelles a la gestion, a la gestion strategique en particulier, c'est que l'on percoit la prise de decision strategique comme un processus visant a la fois la reduction active de l'exposition au risque baissier et l'augmentation de l'exposition aux opportunites favorables. L'approche des options reelles se situe entre la finance pure et les autres domaines de la prise de decision en situation risquee tels l'evaluation de projet, l'entree et la sortie d'un marche, la restructuration et la re-ingenierie organisationnelle, l'adoption de nouvelles technologies, les decisions sur le changement climatique et la biodiversite, etc.. Elle souligne un etat d'esprit et utilise des methodologies auxquelles souscrivent beaucoup de gestionnaires, offrant ainsi un langage commun. Les options reelles concernent plusieurs domaines primordiaux des entreprises modernes : la couverture et le developpement du marche, la finance, la gestion des ressources humaines, la gestion de la technologie, la R&D, la gestion des connaissances, etc.. Cette approche represente un changement important dans la gestion strategique mais demeure relativement peu connue malgre son adoption par des entreprises telles que Airbus, GE, Hewlett Packard, Intel, Toshiba et autres. Neanmoins, comme l'indique la litterature academique et le soulignent certaines des citations ci-dessous, la contribution des gestionnaires a la valeur de l'entreprise peut se mesurer a l'aune des options qu'ils font surgir et qu'ils gerent. A un niveau plus macroeconomique, l'efficacite des systemes financiers repose essentiellement sur une bonne evaluation des risques et de la gestion des projets. Les options reelles constituent l'outil analytique crucial pour cette evaluation et font ainsi le lien entre secteur financier et secteur reel.","citation":"Marcel Boyer et al. (2003)","page":1}

can capture biodiversity values and provide incentives for conservation, and many integrated conservation and development projects include an ecotourism component. One key assumption behind this strategy is that ecotourism businesses can achieve financial viability. This paper presents a financial case study of the well-known community-based ecotourism lodge 'Casa Matsiguenka', owned by an indigenous Matsigenka population in Manu National Park (Peru), only the second such project to be thoroughly analysed in the literature. Built and financed from 1997 to 2003 with German official aid, the lodge's revenues have only just exceeded operating costs and have not covered the costs of infrastructure replacement, thereby failing to secure long-term business sustainability. Wages and income from handicraft sales have covered about a third of individual cash needs in the two participating communities, but communal income from lodge operating profits (for example to pay for community infrastructure, health care or education) has been minimal. The lodge's difficulties are attributed largely to a flawed business plan in which the lodge has sold its services to its own competitors, a group of ecotourism agencies that have used their lobbying power to create a cartel in Manu. In a narrow analysis, the return on investment for this project has been approximately one-third of what could have been achieved to date by merely investing the start-up grant monies in a bank account and paying the interest directly to the Matsigenka communities in exchange for conservation actions. Broader analysis indicates the modest income and slow pace of business so far has permitted gradual social and economic adaptation on the part of culturally conservative indigenous communities. Moreover, the lodge project has generated processes of social and political organization, and sustained positive contact with Peruvian national society, which can be counted among its successes. The lodge has helped produce dialogue between the Park administration and the Matsigenka communities, a process that could ultimately result in co-management agreements that help to resolve people-park conflicts in the Park.","citation":"Julia Ohl‐Schacherer et al.

number of recent publications have pointed out the accelerating speed at which ecosystems and biodiversity are being lost (United Nations Development Programme/United Nations Environment Programme/The World Bank/The World Resources Institute 2000). The general view is that conservation can only be achieved in a global network of protected areas (see Pimm et al . 2001). To safeguard the most important ecosystems, Myers et al . (2000) have suggested that we primarily conserve 25 biodiversity hotspots, in particular forests, comprising 1.4% of the land surface of the Earth. The costs for the conservation of these hotspots have been estimated at US$ 500 million per year ( Myers et al . 2000), while the costs of a global network of protected areas may even reach US$ 27.5 billion per year (James et al . 1999). Even though these costs may seem minor compared to, for example, the costs of global armament, governments in developing countries and environmental organizations are clearly not in the position to finance conservation. It is thus urgent to raise additional funds to safeguard biodiversity. In the following, I suggest a twofold strategy, based on tourism.","citation":"Stefan Gössling (2002)","page":1}

conservation biology has become one of the most exciting research disciplines in the life sciences, it has barely begun to wield its potential power in political or high-level policy fora. As a mission-oriented discipline, conservation biology has been applied to a range of resource-management challenges from its inception. But there is a tremendous mismatch between the scale and scope of the problems that conservation science is now informing and those issues of huge significance that we are now uncovering and should be influencing. Changes to global ecosystems are having massive impacts on biodiversity, and these impacts in turn are profoundly affecting human well-being and the planet's life-support systems. If we are to have real influence on the future of biodiversity, then we must bring the findings of our research to bear on decisions that influence the root causes of problems, not just their symptoms. The issue of climate change provides a lesson in how this can be done. Fifteen years ago, as growing evidence suggested that human-caused greenhouse gas emissions were warming Earth's atmosphere, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) was created to assess research on climate change. Having now published three assessments (each consisting of three 800-page volumes) and multiple syntheses and special reports, the IPCC is widely recognized for its invaluable role in bringing the “state of knowledge” concerning climate science to bear on the needs of decision-makers worldwide. Journalists can always find a naysayer to quote, but news articles now typically note what “the IPCC, involving the majority of the world's leading climate scientists,” has concluded. Every 4 years, the IPCC conducts a new assessment geared to meet the needs of decision-makers in the Framework Convention on Climate Change. Similarly, every 4 years another assessment—the Scientific Effects of Ozone Depletion—is released for the use of the signatories to the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer. Both of these assessments are far more than just useful scientific references; they have become “drivers” of policy change. The Kyoto Protocol to limit greenhouse gas emissions would never have been signed had not the IPCC, just prior to the Kyoto negotiations, released its memorable finding that “the balance of evidence suggests that there is a discernable human influence on global climate.” These assessments have not only elevated the significance of climate change at governmental and intergovernmental levels, but through their regular global coverage by the media they have also significantly increased public awareness of the issues of climate change and ozone depletion. So where is the IPCC for Biodiversity or the IPCC for Nitrogen/Phosphorous Cycles? They simply don't exist. This is not to say that we lack high-quality assessments and studies on these topics; examples abound, such as the United Nations Environment Programme's Global Environmental Outlook, the World Resources Institute/United Nations Environment Programme/World Bank/United Nations Development Programme's World Resources series, the World Conservation Monitoring Centre's Global Biodiversity, and the World Wildlife Fund's Living Planet Report. But none of these comes close to the policy influence of the IPCC, and indeed none of them was underpinned by anything like the scientific consensus-building that characterizes the IPCC. A new assessment closely modeled on the IPCC is now underway—the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment ( MA )—that will attempt to fill this gap in the area of ecosystems and biodiversity ( http://www.millenniumassessment.org ). The MA provides members of the Society for Conservation Biology, and the SCB as a society, with a platform that can be used to increase the influence of conservation biology on decision-making at scales from local to global. If the MA proves its utility to decision-makers, it is anticipated that an integrated ecosystem assessment process modeled on the MA will be repeated every 5 to 10 years. What makes a process like the IPCC succeed in bringing cutting-edge science to bear on decision-making? The Harvard Global Environmental Assessment Project concluded that three factors underlie successful global scientific assessments. First, the successful assessment is scientifically credible. The IPCC involves thousands of scientists ( indeed, a very large fraction of the world's leading climate scientists ) as coordinating lead authors, lead authors, contributing authors, chapter review editors, and expert reviewers. All of the IPCC assessment reports undergo two rounds of peer review involving hundreds of reviewers per chapter. The IPCC focuses on what is known with certainty by the scientific community and what remains uncertain. The IPCC is now the gold standard of scientific opinion on the issue, and areas of broad scientific agreement are no longer lost in a fog of disagreements among scientists over minor issues—previously a problem for climate change scientists and certainly an issue now for biodiversity scientists. Second, the assessment is politically legitimate. It is relatively easy for the government of Germany to ignore a report done by experts in Brazil or for a chief executive officer to ignore the findings of a report by a nongovernmental organization. What possible leverage would such a report have, no matter how good the science it contained? Thousands of assessments and studies are published every year. What gives the IPCC more weight with decision-makers than others? Partly it is the authoritative status of the IPCC. But, equally important, the users of the assessment—in this case, national governments—have fully “bought in” to the process. Governments authorized the IPCC and ultimately approve its findings line by line. Scientists from more than 100 countries are involved as authors. Decision-makers cannot ignore the final product because they have been fully involved in its development. Third, the assessment is salient: it responds to decision-makers' needs. This is not to say that scientists do not have an opportunity to introduce new issues and findings that decision-makers need to be aware of; they do. But the priority for the assessment is to inform decisions that are being faced or soon will be faced by decision-makers There has been one previous attempt to create an IPCC for biodiversity: the Global Biodiversity Assessment (GBA), published in 1995. This impressive 1100-page report prepared by leading biodiversity scientists readily meets the criterion of credibility and is still used as a reference by many scientists. It fell far short, however, on the criteria of political legitimacy and saliency. The GBA was intended to serve as an IPCC-like assessment for the Convention on Biodiversity, but the parties to the convention rejected the report before the work even began and in the end refused to receive or use its findings. Partly because the report was prepared in the absence of any consultation with its intended users, it focused more heavily on scientific debates than on debates with policy implications. In addition, the GBA lacked internal consistency and synthesis, which critically limited the likelihood that any of the relevant data and information it contained might become the focus of continuing monitoring or repeated measures. How does the MA rate against these criteria? On the issue of credibility, the assessment will follow procedures for preparation and review almost identical to those used by the IPCC. A team of globally known social and natural scientists jointly chair the scientific working groups, and leading scientists are being invited from around the world as coordinating lead authors and lead authors. An independent peer review board has been established to oversee the review process. In the end, more than 2000 authors and expert reviewers are likely to be involved in the preparation of the MA. Establishing the legitimacy of the process was the major focus of the 4 years of preparation for the launch of the MA. Four international conventions ( biodiversity, desertification, migratory species, and wetlands ) have now authorized the MA as a source of their assessment input. Like the IPCC, all the working groups are jointly chaired by experts in developed and developing countries and will involve a geographically balanced group of authors. The Secretary General of the United Nations has stated that “The Millennium Ecosystem Assessment is an outstanding example of the sort of international scientific and political cooperation that is needed to further the cause of sustainable development.” Saliency is being achieved through consultations with the users and through several iterations of review of the draft assessment outlines by the international conventions and other intended users in the private sector and civil society. In addition, conventions such as the Convention on Biodiversity have made formal requests for specific types of assessment input. The MA focuses on the consequences of changes to ecosystems for human well-being. It pays particular attention to ecosystem “services” and such issues as changes in biodiversity, land cover, and biogeochemical cycles. It will not attempt to duplicate sectoral assessments like the IPCC or forest or agriculture assessments but will focus extensively on integration across these assessments. Too often, scientists provide information on specific sectors when decisions actually will affect multiple sectors. What good is an assessment that tells decision-makers that we can produce enough crops to feed the world 30 years from now if we cannot also tell them the consequences of that increased production for biodiversity, freshwater quality, and coastal fisheries? The MA chose this broad, integrated focus after consultation with its audiences. Therefore, the findings of the assessment will be relevant not only to a minister of the environment but also to decision-makers who typically have far more influence on the fate of ecosystems, including people in the private sector and in ministries of finance, planning and trade. Biodiversity issues are central to all three of the global MA working group reports and to the MA subglobal assessments. Within the Condition Working Group, one chapter will focus on biodiversity and one on biological regulation. These chapters will assess the state of knowledge about numbers of species, their distribution, their historical extinction rates, the current endangerment of species, and the role of biodiversity in ecosystem functioning. Within the Scenarios Working Group, one team is now developing “biodiversity scenarios”: given plausible future changes in the forces driving ecological change, what will be the consequences for rates of species extinction, the resilience of ecological communities and processes, the goods and services produced by ecosystems, and human health? And, within the Responses Working Group, one chapter will be devoted to case-study experiences with efforts to slow the loss of biodiversity. Another chapter will examine the state of knowledge about the development of indicators and approaches to priority setting for ecosystems and biodiversity. Yet another will examine integrated approaches to the maintenance of biodiversity and ecosystem services. Good science does not always result in good decisions. But we will not arrive at good decisions unless authoritative and useful scientific information is presented to decision-makers through a process they cannot ignore. The Millennium Ecosystem Assessment needs to be based on the very best conservation biology. Members of the Society for Conservation Biology, in turn, now have an opportunity to participate in and contribute to a process modeled on the IPCC that can greatly increase the visibility of the findings of conservation biology and their impact on both global and local decision-making.

The central question for this paper is whether land managers in Panama might protect or restore forests on their lands in response to the market for the existence value of biodiversity. Conservation financing provided by non-Panamanian sources is used as a proxy for investigating the nature of the market for the existence value of biodiversity. Debt-for-nature swaps and environmental trust funds, such as the Global Environment Facility (GEF), provide examples of demand in this market. This paper examines trends and policies that could change the cost of supplying biodiversity protection and factors that could improve or undermine demand for the existence value of biodiversity. If ecological restoration receives as much support within the conservation community as protection of pristine areas has in the past, then demand in this market is likely to remain strong. The largest challenge for this market will be shifting to the provision of biodiversity conservation by private landowners rather than solely by the national government.","citation":"Steven Wallander (2007)","page":1}

paper summarizes the extension of new market mechanisms for environmental services, explains of the importance of generating price information indicative of the cost of mitigating greenhouse gases (GHGs) and presents the rationale and objectives for pilot GHG-trading markets. It also describes the steps being taken to define and launch pilot carbon markets in North America and Europe and reviews the key issues related to incorporating carbon sequestration into an emissions-trading market. There is an emerging consensus to employ market mechanisms to help address the threat of human-induced climate changes. Carbon-trading markets are now in development around the world. A UK market is set to launch in 2002, and the European Commission has called for a 2005 launch of an European Union (EU)-wide market, and a voluntary carbon market is now in formation in North America. These markets represent an initial step in resolving a fundamental problem in defining and implementing appropriate policy actions to address climate change. Policymakers currently suffer from two major information gaps: the economic value of potential damages arising from climate changes are highly uncertain, and there is a lack of reliable information on the cost of mitigating GHGs. These twin gaps significantly reduce the quality of the climate policy debate. The Chicago Climate Exchange, for which the authors serve as lead designers, is intended to provide an organized carbon-trading market involving energy, industry and carbon sequestration in forests and farms. Trading among these diverse sectors will provide price discovery that will help clarify the cost of combating climate change when a wide range of mitigation options is employed. By closing the information gap on mitigation costs, society and policymakers will be far better prepared to identify and implement optimal policies for managing the risks associated with climate change. Establishment of practical experience in providing tradeable credits for carbon-absorbing land-use practices, especially reforestation and conservation management of agricultural soils, will also help demonstrate the viability of a new tool for financing activities that improve water quality, support biodiversity and constitute important elements of long-term sustainability in land-use management.","citation":"Richard L.

analytic framework that can be used to measure and monitor empowerment processes and outcomes. The measuring empowerment framework, rooted in both conceptual discourse and measurement practice, illustrates how to gather data on empowerment and structure its analysis. The framework can be used to measure empowerment at both the intervention level and the country level, as a part of poverty or governance monitoring. The authors first provide a definition of empowerment and then explain how the concept can be reduced to measurable components. Empowerment is defined as a person's capacity to make effective choices—that is, the capacity to transform choices into desired actions and outcomes. The extent or degree to which a person is empowered is influenced by personal agency (the capacity to make purposive choice) and opportunity structure (the institutional context in which choice is made). Asset endowments are used as indicators of agency. These assets may be psychological, informational, organizational, material, social, financial, or human. Opportunity structure is measured by the presence and operation of formal and informal institutions, including the laws, regulatory frameworks, and norms governing behavior. Degrees of empowerment are measured by the existence of choice, the use of choice, and the achievement of choice. Following the conceptual discussion and the presentation of the analytic framework, the authors show how the measuring empowerment framework can be applied using examples from four development interventions. Each example discusses how the framework guided analysis and development of empowerment indicators. They also present a draft module for measuring empowerment at the country level. The module can be used alone or be integrated into country-level poverty or governance monitoring systems that seek to add an empowerment dimension to their analysis. This paper—a product of the Poverty Reduction Group, Poverty Reduction and Economic Management Network—is part of a larger effort in the network to conceptualize, operationalize, and measure empowerment.

for analyzing tropical deforestation and reforestation using the von Thunen model as its starting point: land is allocated to the use which yields the highest rent, and the rents of various land uses are determined by location. Forest cover change therefore becomes a question of changes in rent of forest versus non-forest use. While this is a simple and powerful starting point, more intriguing issues arise when this is applied to analyze real cases. An initial shift in the rent of one particular land use generates feedbacks which affect the rent of all land uses. For example, a new technology in extensive agriculture should make this land use more profitable and lead to more forest clearing, but general equilibrium effects (changes in prices and local wages) can modify or even reverse this conclusion. Another issue is how a policy change or a shift in broader market, technological, and institutional forces will affect various land use rents. The paper deals with three such areas: technological progress in agriculture, land tenure regimes, and community forest management. The second part of the paper links the von Thunen framework to the forest transition theory. The forest transition theory describes a sequence over time where a forested region goes through a period of deforestation before the forest cover eventually stabilizes and starts to increase. This sequence can be seen as a systematic pattern of change in the agricultural and forest land rents over time. Increasing agricultural rent leads to high rates of deforestation. The slow-down of deforestation and eventual reforestation is due to lower agricultural rents (the economic development path) and higher forest rent (the forest scarcity path). Various forces leading to these changes are discussed and supported by empirical evidence from different tropical regions.

The author goes on to develop an original analytical treatment of the incremental cost financing mechanisms adopted by the Convention on Biological Diversity. Significantly, he undertakes a microeconomic study of land use change in a biosphere reserve in South-East Mexico. Based on an original data set, the author presents a detailed modelling exercise of resource and land use choices at the individual farm level with related projections of the impact at both community and regional levels. Techniques used include multi-period linear programming and dynamic stock-flow simulation. The book concludes by addressing policy implications and options for future research.","citation":"Raffaello Cervigni (2001)","page":1}

Baltic Sea is one of the largest brackish water bodies in the world (Segerstråle 1957) with a number of basins varying from almost fresh water in the northern part of the Bothnian Bay via the more brackish conditions in the southern part to the saline waters of the Kattegat. The Baltic Sea is subject to severe environmental degradation caused by commercial and leisure activities, including fisheries, dredging, tourism, coastal development and land-based pollution sources. This causes severe pressures on vulnerable marine habitats and natural resources, and a tool for aiding marine management is therefore strongly needed. The marine landscape concept presented by Roff &amp;Taylor (2000) is based on the use of available broad-scale geological, physical and hydrographical data to prepare ecologically meaningful maps for areas with little or no biological information. The concept, which was elaborated by Day &amp; Roff (2000) was applied in UK waters (Connor et al. 2006) before it was adopted by the BALANCE project described here. The aim of developing marine landscape maps is to characterise the marine environment of the Baltic Sea region (the Baltic Sea together with the Kattegat) using geophysical and hydrographical parameters. Such maps can be applied, for example, to an assessment of the Baltic-wide network of marine protected areas, and thus provide a sustainable ecosystem-based approach to the protection of the marine environment from human activities, and contribute to the conservation of marine biodiversity. The BALANCE project is based on transnational and cross-sectoral co-operation with participants from nine countries surrounding the Baltic Sea as well as Norway (Fig. 1), and is partially financed by the European Union through the BSR INTERREG IIIB programme.","citation":"Zyad Al‐Hamdani et al.

S. Wertz-Kanounnikoff Iddri – Idees pour le debat N° 12/2006. 4 Introduction Although environmental services (ES) are essential for human wellbeing and all life on earth, they deteriorate at an alarming rate: according to the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (2005), nearly two-thirds of the world’s environmental services are currently under threat. Environmental services are hereby understood as the benefits humans obtain from ecosystems including carbon sequestration, biodiversity conservation or watershed protection. This perception differs from the OECD employment of the term which refers to wastewater management services, solid-waste management services, sanitation and similar services and other environmental services (OECD 2005). In recent years, the recognition of environmental services and their value has led to efforts to internalize environmental services through direct payments for environmental services (PES). From an economic perspective, the loss of ES is explained by the fact that most of these services present externalities or public goods to which, as long as provided for free, their owners will not give much attention when making land use decisions. The idea of PES consists therefore of external ES beneficiaries making direct, contractual and conditional payments to local landholders and users in return for adopting practices that secure ecosystem conservation and restoration and thus the provision of ES (Wunder 2005). In this way land users are expected to receive a direct incentive to include ES in their land use decisions, ideally resulting in more socially optimal land uses than would occur in the absence of such payments. The concept of PES has experienced growing interest over the last years in both developed and developing countries. A wide range of theoretical and practical work is currently being pursued around the world and many different organizations are involved. These include research organizations, think tanks, non-governmental organization, government agencies and private companies. Most initiatives so far have been conducted in developed countries, notably the United States and Australia, but increasingly more activities are also emerging in developing countries such as in Costa Rica, Mexico or Kenya just to name some examples. Moreover, interest is also emerging to further explore the potential of PES to become an international mechanism for biodiversity finance. Specifically, the 8th Conference of the Parties of the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) held in Curitiba in March 2006 identifies as one of its focal areas the “maintenance of goods and services from biodiversity to support human wellbeing” and the need to explore innovative financial mechanisms for the implementation of the CBD and its 2010 biodiversity targets (CBD-8th COP 2006). In September 2006, an international experts’ workshop organized by UN Environment Program (UNEP) and the World Conservation Union (IUCN), in close collaboration with the CBD Secretariat, started to explore the potentials for international payments for biodiversity conservation services. In light of these developments, this note reviews the current debate on PES for biodiversity conservation by focusing specifically on its economic, social and ecological impacts. The term “conservation” is hereby understood as “the management of human use of the biosphere so that is may yield the greatest sustainable benefit to the present generation while maintaining its potential to meet the needs and aspirations of future generations” (Markandya et al. 2001). Based on a literature review, this note starts with a brief presentation of the concept before dealing with current practical approaches. It continues with a discussion on economic, ecological, and social considerations of PES, and ends with some tentative conclusions.","citation":"S. Wertz-Kanounnikoff (2006)","page":1}

is prudent to conserve communities which are as species-rich as possible. This is the only means of ensuring that species diversity but also gene diversity is high enough to allow for the necessary adaptations to changed environmental conditions. Arable plant communities are a special case here because losses in the last 5 decades have been particularly severe. Numerous studies from Central Europe reported dramatic declines of the segetal flora.In most of the federal states of Germany, successful measures for protecting the segetal flora, such as the establishment of field flora reserves and field margin strip programmes have often unfortunately come to a halt due to changes in funding, lack of regional support or high levels of bureaucracy. The new project fields for biodiversity, which has been funded by the Deutsche Bundesstiftung Umwelt (DBU) since 2007, aims to establish a network of protected areas for the preservation of endangered segetal species in Germany. Management aimed at preserving and fostering arable wild is to be guaranteed in the long term on at least 100 particularly suitable arable sites.The feasibility study, funded by the DBU during 2007-2008 undertook: 1)Identification of floristically valuable arable sites throughout Germany and their incorporation in a database; 2)Compilation of an overview of field flora reserves/conservation fields still in existence based on a countrywide search; 3)Discussions about funding instruments and the options for implementing protection measures at a regional level with governmental authorities of all the federal states of Germany (excluding Hamburg, Bremen and Berlin); 4)Analysis of several alternative strategies for long-term financing of arable plant conservation.The project fields for biodiversity - establishing a nationwide conservation field network for wild arable plants - is a national endeavour to provide a network of conservation sites as a long-term response to the loss of arable wild which has advanced unabated for decades. As a first milestone in the implementation phase it is aimed at securing 30 sites during the first two years of the project. By the end of the entire funding period there should be a network of at least 100 conservation fields under long-term protection. This is a unique opportunity in the history of the protection of arable wild of creating an urgently needed conservation system with at least medium-term protection for native arable wild plants.","citation":"Stefan Meyer et al.

book provides an evaluation of, and policy advice on key environmental, social, and economic issues concerning the development of nature tourism. Using KwaZulu-Natal in South Africa as a case study, it highlights both the benefits, and trade-offs I promoting, an managing sustainable nature-tourism development, and it assesses how policy can enhance nature tourism's contribution to economic growth, poverty reduction, and conservation. The book's contributors explore three key issues. First, they consider the importance of moving beyond development of a wildlife industry, to the creation of a true nature tourism economy, that supports biodiversity conservation. Second, they explore the role of the private sector in contributing to equitable development, and job creation, while generating conservation finance. Third, they consider alternative pricing, and other market mechanisms that can help make nature tourism more viable, and growth-oriented. Ultimately, the authors argue, economic development, equity, and conservation objectives can be balanced.","citation":"Bruce Aylward & E. Lutz (2003)","page":1}

update summarizes the efforts of the World Bank Group (WBG) since 1988 to support the efforts of client countries and partners to conserve and sustainably manage biodiversity. The portfolio update, however, concentrates primarily on projects financed through the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD), the International Development Association (IDA), the Pilot Program to Conserve the Brazilian Rainforest (RFTF), and the Global Environment Facility (GEF). Over the past decade, the International Finance Corporation (IFC) has also contributed to biodiversity conservation. Stand-alone biodiversity projects as well as biodiversity-related sectoral projects which explicitly describe and include biodiversity activities are examined. Examples of projects which address the dual goals of poverty alleviation and conservation are also described.","citation":"Gonzalo Castro et al. (2000)","page":1}

collection of essays on extreme poverty. The first part of the report deals with what it means to live in extreme poverty, how to reach the very poor, through programs, and interventions, and how to make private, and public institutions more responsive to their aspirations. The second part analyzes the relationship between extreme poverty, and human rights. Emphasis is placed on the contribution of the International Movement ATD Fourth World, and its founder Joseph Wresinski, to the understanding of the very poor, and what is needed for\" attacking extreme poverty\".

the context of ecosystem conservation, tropical dry forests have received little or no attention compared with their next-door neighbors, the tropical rainforests. This lack of conservation effort in tropical dry forests is reflected in the fact that few national parks and biological reserves protect and preserve their natural richness, and there are only a handful of real biological research stations with a mandate to bridge the gap between ecology and conservation biology in these ecosystems. The funding and legal framework developed by international institutions and local governments has been implemented mainly to protect mature forest or pristine national parks located in regions other than dry forests. Several complex reasons may explain the lack of protection afforded to tropical dry forests. One of them is rooted in the romanticized vision that the tropics do not exist beyond the Amazon basin, a vision one finds every day in the scientific and nonscientific literature and in the electronic media. Another reason is the high economic value associated with goods and services that can be extracted from tropical dry forests, which contrasts with the relatively small economic value of tropical rainforests. This exploitation is furthered by local and national governments when they use dry forests not as the last frontier but as the first frontier of economic development. In the Caribbean, Mesoamérica, and northern South America, tropical dry forests are located in the most fertile zones for agroindustry and ecotourism development, and they contain a large proportion of the human population. Thus, only a small proportion of their total area is under some level of conservation. In Mesoamérica and in Venezuela, <1% of this ecologically, socially, and economically essential ecosystem is protected. Tropical dry forests are in dire need of integrated and multidisciplinary conservation research projects aimed at expanding traditional species- and niche-based research; increasing the biological and ecological knowledge base; and including human dimensions, which inevitably underlie how ecosystems change over time. Ecological studies on tropical dry forest succession, degradation, and restoration are few and most of them have been generated from a few sites. Tied to these ecological studies, conservation schemes are necessary that emphasize the tropical dry forest's contribution to environmental services and its value as a forest ecosystem, rather than as range or agricultural land. Rather than solely promoting the conservation of forest patches that will form isolated national parks or reserves, conservation approaches that pay landowners for environmental services must be implemented. Integrated land-management plans that complement the efforts of governments and the private sector must be enforced. The payment for ecosystem services carried out by the Costa Rican National Forest Financing Fund (FONAFIFO) is a good example of the feasibility of such initiatives. Furthermore, efforts toward conservation of tropical dry forests must also address the need to consider ecosystem services provided by mature ecosystems and areas at various successional stages within and outside public lands. In fact, secondary dry forests may be the dominant landscape in the forthcoming years, as land abandoned by local farmers recovers. In Costa Rica alone, almost 50% of the Guanacaste Peninsula is covered by deciduous secondary forests. Payment for ecosystem services in the tropics, however, requires funds that are largely unavailable. For a payment strategy to succeed, it is critical that national environmental authorities display the necessary political will to invest resources and develop the required regulatory framework. But it is also fundamental that the governments of developed countries, as well as multinational agencies, international conservation organizations, and private donors, look beyond humid tropical ecosystems and expand their portfolio of conservation investments toward tropical dry forests. We could uncover a wealth of valuable information by consciously promoting land-use practices that minimize the amount of stress and land-cover conversion carried out around dry forested areas. Such an approach, combined with educational programs that promote bioliteracy in local schools and community decision-making organizations, would highlight the economic and ecological value of the tropical dry forest as an ecosystem. This approach would further uncover the contributions of tropical dry forests to society, a role that far surpasses their value for anything else. Such an approach, however, can only be explored and demonstrated by further investigating how to successfully integrate alternative land uses into the management of dry forest ecosystems. With an increasing population, a long history of land-use change, and free-trade agreements that encourage large agroindustry developments (e.g., extensive cattle ranching, and watermelon and sugarcane plantations in Mexico and Costa Rica) and a significant increase of their exploitation for ecotourism, the future of tropical dry forests, at least in the Caribbean, Mesoamérica, and northern South America, is of great concern. Land-use choices that are made around these forests will continue to influence their rapid degradation regardless of how many studies we conduct to find out what it is needed to promote their conservation. The remaining dry forests, which include numerous rare and endemic species, offer a unique opportunity to learn more about types of interactions between species and the resulting ecological processes. This information, in turn, would be of tremendous help to policy makers responsible for defining sustainable development policies aimed at benefiting threatened species (e.g., Scarlet Macaw [Ara macao], Yellow-shouldered Parrot [Amazona barbadensis], jaguar [Panthera onca], Baird's tapir [Tapirus bairdii], great false vampire bat [Vampyrum spectrum)], guayacán [Guaiacum sanctum]). More studies are also needed to understand the ecological succession of disturbed tropical dry forest left in fragments and its contribution as a stepping stone between fragments and the forest. Because small populations or communities may be recovering in regenerating fragments, these areas should not be considered waste land but rather important elements that connect protected areas. Furthermore, the immediate sharing of this ecological knowledge with local communities would help convince them to invest in the longevity of this ecosystem and to promote the recovery of degraded areas. An additional and highly contentious topic is the conflict between increasing human demands on water resources and the varying water needs of the differing components of the tropical forest matrix. The matrix is composed of deciduous tropical forest, mangroves, wetlands, savannas, and riparian forests. Such biological wealth is currently endangered by human water demands that depend on this limited resource. Increasing and uncontrolled use of limited water resources for irrigation, human consumption, and tourism—a phenomenon that translates into new dams, deviation of rivers, and the use of river discharge during low-flow seasons—jeopardizes the future of tropical dry forest biodiversity. We believe that research and conservation in tropical dry forests must generate conservation models that are promoted with the same fervor as those designed for humid forests. For example, phenological aspects (e.g., leaf shed, flowering, fruiting) have been especially neglected in large-scale studies, downplaying the fact that part of the uniqueness of this ecosystem is its phenological responses to changing environmental conditions. These \"preadaptations\" may be essential as global-change-coping mechanisms by tropical biotas. Many questions have yet to be answered. But if we are to understand the phenological responses of individual species and the drivers and effects of degradation and land exploitation on the phenological cycles of the ecosystem at a larger scale—including the organisms that depend on them—more comprehensive conservation efforts are necessary. These efforts must be linked to adequate funding levels that promote comprehensive in situ and comparative studies among dry forest ecosystems across the Americas.","citation":"Arturo Sánchez‐Azofeifa et al.

order to increase protected area revenue, and as part of a drive for national economic development, the Cambodian government is starting to issue economic concessions in 'sustainable development zones' of of protected areas. The Phnom Aural and Phnom Samkos wildlife sanctuaries cover nearly 600,000 ha and are important for biodiversity conservation and environmental services. They are home to about 30,000 people who rely on subsistence agriculture, cattle raising, and collection of non-timber forest products for their livelihoods. Under the Cardamom Mountains Wildlife Sanctuaries Project, a joint project of the Cambodian Ministry of Environment and Fauna and Flora International, zoning plans have been developed for both sanctuaries through participatory consultation with local stakeholders. But the sanctuaries face threats from clearance of land by in-migrating settlers and the granting of economic concessions. Management of the wildlife sanctuaries is currently heavily dependent on donor finance and there is concern about post project sustainability. Thus there is a need to develop long-term sustainable finance for their management. Part of this challenge is demonstrating the value to Cambodia of continuing to protect the two sanctuaries. This will help to make the case for greater government support to the management of the sanctuaries whether through financial input or through discouraging/preventing economic activities that undermine the effectiveness of protection. This paper reports on a study to provide a set of options for the locally-derived sustainable financing of Phnom Samkos and Phnom Aural. The study has two main components: ecological services valuation - assessing the economic value of the direct and indirect ecosystem services provided by the two sanctuaries, and the potential costs/benefits of allowing continuing land conversion and illegal logging; and protected area financing - assessing the costs of maintaining management activities and recommendations for generating funds.","citation":"Maryanne Grieg‐Gran et al.

public resources for the environment puts pressure on African\r\nresource managers and policy makers to develop alternative strategies\r\nfor financing protected areas. Nature tourism is the fastest growing\r\nsector in many African countries and is regarded as an opportunity to\r\nprovide funding for conservation. However, studies on the economic value\r\nof tourism show that there is often a significant gap between nature\r\ntourism’s actual and potential contribution to biodiversity conservation.\r\nPark entry fees are the most important source of revenue for protected\r\nareas, but the degree of revenue capture is low, due to inappropriate\r\npricing policies and inefficient financial management systems.\r\nImproving efficiency in park pricing is an important step towards\r\nachieving economic sustainability in protected area management. Examples\r\nof innovative pricing policies are price differentiation between tourists of\r\ndifferent origin, differential pricing of parks and linking foreign tourists’\r\npark fees to a hard currency value. The key to efficient pricing is a sound\r\nunderstanding of supply and demand in the nature tourism market. A\r\ncomparison of pricing policies across eastern and southern Africa shows\r\nto what extent African countries make use of such approaches.","citation":"W. Krug (2000)","page":1}

the last several decades, the intensity and scale of forest exploitation have increased significantly. A large number of developing countries experiencing increasing deforestation trends are also facing acute shortages of fuelwood, fodder, industrial t imber, and other forest products for domestic USC . Besides potential environmental degradation, depletion of forests and trees may exacerbate poverty, displace indigenous populations, and impede agricultural productivity. Deforestation, especially in the humid t ropics , has ser ious regional and global implicat ions (potent ia l c l imate change, loss of biodiversity, and degradation of large watersheds). To address these problems, a cooperative effort on a global scale is needed to assist countries in implementing effective, long-term forest conservation and management programmes. An essential element of this effort is the establishment of an internat ional fund to provide f inancial support for ini t iat ives to s tabi l ize forests in developing countries. Given that many countries with urgent forest resource problems have limited financial resources and many of the benefits of improved forest management and conservation are global in nature, a strong argument can be made for international cost-sharing (see for example Sharma et a l . , 1992) . Governments that provide financing for development and conservation programmes are interested in knowing the extent of public support for such act ivi t ies . To assess the economic value of benefi ts to US residents from rainforest protection activit ies in the tropics, a national mail survey was employed. These benefi ts were estimated with the contingent valuation method (CVM), a non-market valuation technique widely used to value environmental amenities (Smith, 1993). Most applicat ions of CVM have been directed toward assigning economic values to local , regional, or national environmental goods. This study represents one of the first applications of CVM for a global environmental good. This chapter describes the design and implementat ion of the survey and presents analysis of the resul ts .","citation":"Randall A. Kramer et al. (1996)","page":1}

for environmental services (PES) are a promising mechanism for conservation. PES could either provide additional funding for protected areas, pay land users to conserve biodiversity outside protected areas, or both. For PES to work, it requires a secure long-term source of financing. Obtaining payments directly for biodiversity conservation is difficult, however. In most cases, water users are the most likely such source, either directly or indirectly. Thus the potential for PES to help conserve biodiversity depends, in a large measure, on the degree to which areas of interest for conservation of water services overlap with areas of interest for conservation of biodiversity. This paper examines the extent of such overlap in the case of highland Guatemala. The results show that this potential varies substantially within the country, with some biodiversity conservation priority areas having very good potential for receiving payments, and others little or none. Overall, about a quarter of all biodiversity conservation priority areas have potential for receiving payments. Thus PES is far from being a silver bullet for biodiversity conservation, but it can make a meaningful contribution to this objective.","citation":"Stefano Pagiola et al. (2009)","page":1}

Commercial agriculture in South Africa has in the past mostly been focusing on existing traditional crops for their land use activities. The new generation rural farmers cannot commercially compete with traditional agriculture and have to investigate new and alternative crops to become competitive. New crop development is needed to create opportunities for sustaining livelihoods, and to develop strong linkages between agriculture and the rest of the economy. According to Simbi and Aliber (2000), agricultural employment in South Africa’s commercial farming sector is declining. From 1988 to 1998, 140,000 regular jobs (20%) were shed, requiring new job developments. Aspects of commercialization including market information, entrepreneurial and business skills training, social awareness, access to finance, and environmental awareness need to be addressed to create sustainable agribusinesses. Several international treaties have an influence on the commercialization of indigenous crops. However, legislation and regulations with regard to Indigenous Knowledge Systems are not yet in place in South Africa, making it difficult to work on indigenous plants. Furthermore the research and development of the commercialization process is lengthy and costly (Coetzee 2001; Niederwiesser et al. 1998; Wessels et al. 1998). The large and rich biodiversity of the indigenous plants of South Africa offers a valuable source for investigation into new crops. Research funding for indigenous crops is a limiting factor in scientific evaluations and trials to commercialize new crops, but worthwhile results have been achieved by academic institutions with regard to basic taxonomic documentation and general botany. Research by the Agricultural Research Council in South Africa focusing on the commercialization of indigenous plant material has contributed to the establishment of alternative and new crops. Research has been conducted in the field of floriculture using fynbos [characteristic vegetation type in the Cape Floristic Region, and readily recognized by presence of large numbers of species and individuals of Proteaceae (Protea, Leucadendron, Leucospermum), Ericaceae, Rutaceae, and Restionaceae, while Poaceae, the true grasses, are rare] and bulbous plants (Ornithogalum, Lachenalia, Gladiolus, Crinum). Indigenous crops for tea purposes include rooibos (Aspalathus) and honeybush (Cyclopia). Medicinal plants include buchu (Agathosma), aloes (Aloe), and Hypoxis. Indigenous vegetables derived from Amaranthus spp., Cleome, Dovyalis, Plectranthus, and Vigna have also been extensively researched for commercialization purposes. Although some of these plants are only useful to fill small niche markets, others have the potential to become new products for consumers, while others such as the rooibos and honeybush tea industries are expanding with a world market. Proteaceae flowers are already a definite component of the international flower trade. To implement the research results in rural farming operations have proved to be difficult. In many cases these farmers are the legal owners of the original genetic material and must participate in benefit sharing. They have been using these products or derived-from products for centuries and should benefit in the transition from wild harvested plants into commercial crops. By making technology available to rural farmers and communities is however only one part of the process of commercialization. Other aspects that are required include market information, entrepreneurial and business skills training, social awareness, environmental awareness, and access to finance. Together with cultivation technology these factors must be addressed to assist rural farmers in South Africa to enter the mainstream economy.","citation":"E. Y. Reinten et al. (2002)","page":1}

the biological species concept, the intraspecific variability and true species richness of Palearctic mammals has often been overlooked, and therefore the need to conserve it. Recovery projects of endangered European mammals in Western Europe rely mainly upon translocation of conspecifics from viable populations in Central or Eastern Europe. From a wildlife management and restoration ecology point of view, many such recovery projects have been successful. However, from a biodiversity perspective it could be argued that they could have failed to protect the original European biodiversity. The increasing evidence of a complex phylogeographic pattern in many European mammals - especially in the Mediterranean region - has led to a reconsideration of the conservation unit and highlights the need for species-specific programmes for assuring the survival of threa- tened, distinctive populations. Such programs should also include captive breeding. It is the- refore suggested that a two-level classification of captive breeding programmes is needed according to the degree of threat of concerned taxa, to maximise available resources without jeopardising in situ conservation. It is proposed to distinguish between a) level I captive breeding programmes, which are part of the conservation strategy for seriously threatened taxa and need to be financed by state or federal agencies, and b) prophylactic level II for vulnerable taxa or populations, and for which funds may be available mainly from the pri- vate sector. Available evidence suggests that given adequate husbandry techniques and pre- release training, even captive-bred carnivores can be successfully reintroduced to the wild. However, a closer collaboration among zoological gardens, zoologists and agencies invol- ved in wildlife conservation is needed to avoid ill-conceived, potentially dangerous captive- breeding and re-introduction projects.","citation":"Spartaco Gippoliti (2004)","page":1}

This paper analyses the political process for handling an outbreak of an insect causing human allergic reactions. In the southern part of the Swedish island Gotland in the Baltic Sea, an outbreak of the northern pine processionary moth, Thaumetopoea pinivora, has occurred. With regard to the human nuisance and long-term effects on the tourist industry, demands have been raised for intervention to reduce and control the insect population. At the same time, there have been warnings against treating the insect population because there are knowledge gaps concerning the wider ecological consequences, including effects on biodiversity. This paper analyses the political process and its problem-solving efforts. Of particular interest is how it dealt with the issue of uncertainty. It was found that the uncertainty associated with the issue hindered the development of a shared understanding of the problem and a possible solution. There seems to be a growing need in society to develop the institutional capacity to handle complex issues that cross different sectors, regulatory frameworks and policy targets.

is praised askidney of the earth and regarded as one of three main ecosystems,besides forest and ocean on the earth.Apart from offering human being food,materials and water resources,wetland has important environment regulating function and irreplaceable effects on maintaining regional ecological balance,conserving biodiversity and precious species,etc..Maqu wetland in the upper Yellow River has special ecological function because of its special geographical location.However,it is very serious in drying,shrinking and degradation of wetland in Maqu county.Damages and causes of wetland degradation of Maqu county in the upper Yellow River were mainly expounded in the paper.The damages of wetland degradation in Maqu county mainly include rapidly decreasing of water conservation function,aggravating of soil erosion,sharply reducing of biodiversity,largely degrading of wetland grassland and increasing of ecological refugee.The causes of wetland degradation are the results of both natural factors and factitious factors.The natural factors mainly include climate warming,precipitation reducing,groundwater level declining and geological structure of soil changing;the influences of human activities mainly include overgrazing,excessively digging,frequently occurring of rats and pests disaster and increasingly enlarging of wetland grassland desertification area.The corresponding protection countermeasures of Maqu wetland were presented,including raising the environment protecting consciousness of local people,reinforcing lawmaking of wetland,perfecting wetland policy and law,increasing financing investment,enhancing wetland science and technology research and application,developing wetland ecological tourism resources,truly fulfilling grassland contract system and strictly controlling grazing intensity.With regard to protection of wetland,there need not only improving of rules and regulations,but mature control techniques as well and the regulations should be prior to the techniques.The degradation of wetland in Maqu county can not be solved drastically until the regulations are enhanced,legal system are perfected and the consciousness of people' improved continually.At the same time,it must be done for wetlands to adopt the advanced,operable in Maqu county,effective and feasible control techniques as well as long term control and protection.","citation":"Qi Deng (2007)","page":1}

has been touted as a source of finance for biodiversity conservation. Recent work has suggested that the bioprospecting value of the marginal unit of genetic resources is likely to be vanishingly small, creating essentially no conservation incentive. This result is shown to flow specifically from a stylized description of the research process as one of brute-force testing, unaided by an organizing scientific framework. Scientific models channel research effort towards leads for which the expected productivity of discoveries is highest. Leads of unusual promise then command information rents, associated with their role in reducing the costs of search. When genetic materials are abundant, information rents are virtually unaffected by increases in the profitability of product discovery, and decline as technology improvements lower search costs. Numerical simulation results suggest that, under plausible conditions, the bioprospecting value of certain genetic resources could be large enough to support market-based conservation of biodiversity.","citation":"Gordon C.

Message: District and provincial government policy makers in Sumatra, Indonesia are integrating ecosystem services and biodiversity into Sumatra’s next land-use plan. This ecosystem-based spatial plan guides local government planners in decisions on whether, and where, to award concessions for economic activities, such as oil palm and pulp and paper plantations. An ecosystem service mapping and modeling tool called InVEST was used to assess the quantity and location of high quality habitat, carbon storage and sequestration, annual water yield, erosion control, and water purification under two scenarios, representing implementation of the current government spatial plan and an ‘Ecosystem Vision’ of sustainable land use that better balances environmental, social and economic considerations. This information is helping to design and locate the best areas for conservation activities such as forest restoration, sustainable finance mechanisms such as payments for carbon and watershed services, and best management practices for forestry and plantations.","citation":"Thomas Barano et al.

Kariba Dam, completed during the second half of the 1950s, was the first mainstream dam built on the Zambezi River. Its construction was partially financed by the largest loan that the World Bank had given up until that time. Considered a successful project even by affected people based on cost benefit analysis, Kariba also involved unacceptable environmental and social impacts. The involuntary resettlement of 57,000 people within the reservoir basin and immediately downstream from the dam was responsible for serious environmental degradation which was one of a number of factors that left a majority of those resettled impoverished. Other factors included inadequate institutional capacity, inadequate opportunities, adverse rural-urban terms of trade, the war for Zimbabwes independence and the bankruptcy of the political economy of Zambia. \r\nBuilt as a single purpose hydro project, Karibas construction drastically altered, and regularized, the Zambezis natural regime. That adversely affected the flood recession agriculture of Zambian villagers living below the dam as well as the size and biodiversity of the Zambezi delta and the productivity of Mozambiques offshore fishery. Failure to properly drawdown the Kariba and Cahora Bassa reservoirs prior to increased rainfall during the 1999-2000 and 2000-2001 rainy seasons caused significant downstream loss of life, crops, and village and urban infrastructure in February-March 2000 and 2001.","citation":"Thayer Scudder (2005)","page":1}

of temperate rainforests in Chile has decreased the provision of ecosystem services, including watershed protection, biodiversity conservation, and carbon sequestration. Forest conservation can restore those ecosystem services. Greenhouse gas policies that offer financing for the carbon emissions avoided by preventing deforestation require a projection of future baseline carbon emissions for an area if no forest conservation occurs. For a proposed 570 km{sup 2} conservation area in temperate rainforest around the rural community of Curinanco, Chile, we compared three methods to project future baseline carbon emissions: extrapolation from Landsat observations, Geomod, and Forest Restoration Carbon Analysis (FRCA). Analyses of forest inventory and Landsat remote sensing data show 1986-1999 net deforestation of 1900 ha in the analysis area, proceeding at a rate of 0.0003 y{sup -1}. The gross rate of loss of closed natural forest was 0.042 y{sup -1}. In the period 1986-1999, closed natural forest decreased from 20,000 ha to 11,000 ha, with timber companies clearing natural forest to establish plantations of non-native species. Analyses of previous field measurements of species-specific forest biomass, tree allometry, and the carbon content of vegetation show that the dominant native forest type, broadleaf evergreen (bosque siempreverde), contains 370 {+-} 170 t ha{sup -1} carbon, compared to the carbon density of non-native Pinus radiata plantations of 240 {+-} 60 t ha{sup -1}. The 1986-1999 conversion of closed broadleaf evergreen forest to open broadleaf evergreen forest, Pinus radiata plantations, shrublands, grasslands, urban areas, and bare ground decreased the carbon density from 370 {+-} 170 t ha{sup -1} carbon to an average of 100 t ha{sup -1} (maximum 160 t ha{sup -1}, minimum 50 t ha{sup -1}). Consequently, the conversion released 1.1 million t carbon. These analyses of forest inventory and Landsat remote sensing data provided the data to evaluate the three methods to project future baseline carbon emissions. Extrapolation from Landsat change detection uses the observed rate of change to estimate change in the near future. Geomod is a software program that models the geographic distribution of change using a defined rate of change. FRCA is an integrated spatial analysis of forest inventory, biodiversity, and remote sensing that produces estimates of forest biodiversity and forest carbon density, spatial data layers of future probabilities of reforestation and deforestation, and a projection of future baseline forest carbon sequestration and emissions for an ecologically-defined area of analysis. For the period 1999-2012, extrapolation from Landsat change detection estimated a loss of 5000 ha and 520,000 t carbon from closed natural forest; Geomod modeled a loss of 2500 ha and 250 000 t; FRCA projected a loss of 4700 {+-} 100 ha and 480,000 t (maximum 760,000 t, minimum 220,000 t). Concerning labor time, extrapolation for Landsat required 90 actual days or 120 days normalized to Bachelor degree level wages; Geomod required 240 actual days or 310 normalized days; FRCA required 110 actual days or 170 normalized days. Users experienced difficulties with an MS-DOS version of Geomod before turning to the Idrisi version. For organizations with limited time and financing, extrapolation from Landsat change provides a cost-effective method. Organizations with more time and financing could use FRCA, the only method where that calculates the deforestation rate as a dependent variable rather than assuming a deforestation rate as an independent variable. This research indicates that best practices for the projection of baseline carbon emissions include integration of forest inventory and remote sensing tasks from the beginning of the analysis, definition of an analysis area using ecological characteristics, use of standard and widely used geographic information systems (GIS) software applications, and the use of species-specific allometric equations and wood densities developed for local species.","citation":"Patrick Gonzalez et al.

many countries, lack of awareness, capacity and technology availability are among the strongest constraints to maintain or enhance biodiversity levels. From the activities being developed under the Climate Change convention we can observe that the introduction of a market mechanism accelerates the process of Capacity Building and Technology Transfer through greater bottom-up demand and more top-down funding. A similar market mechanism for Biodiversity could greatly increase finance streams to projects and to Capacity Building and Technology Transfer. However, despite several early attempts to market biodiversity in one form or other, it is clear that a real market mechanism does not yet exist. There are some serious constraints to its development, among which the lack of international legal frameworks, product definition and property rights are but a few, and it will take much time and effort to overcome these. In the meantime, there is a synergy between Climate Change and Biodiversity markets that deserves to be developed further. Many Climate Change mitigation activities, particularly in the forestry sector, show additional biodiversity benefits, and in some cases buyers of forestry ‘carbon credits’ may be prepared to pay extra for this added value. This interrelationship provides the opportunity to let the existing Climate Change market function as a booster for Biodiversity Capacity Building and Technology Transfer. In this paper two case studies are presented that exemplift this. One is the technology transfer of Reduced Impact Logging methodologies to SE-Asian logging companies, in the early years of the Climate Change negotiations (forest management is no longer eligible under the Kyoto Protocol’s CDM). The other is a recent project in Colombia that seeks to sell ‘environmental shares’ in combination with carbon credits.","citation":"J. Fehse (2003)","page":1}

thesis is concerned with the accountability of public international financial institutions to their constituencies at global and local geographic scales. It investigates the compliance of the World Bank and the Global Environment Facility (GEF) with their own environmental and social policies as they relate to biodiversity protection. While the World Bank and the GEF pursue a global environmental agenda, their environmental and social policies commit the institutions to building bridges between the global and the local levels by requiring the participation of locally affected communities in decision-making. The study investigates the compliance with the policies in a specific geographic, political and economic space. Cameroon was chosen because both institutions consider the country's biodiversity to be of global significance and are financing operations which have indirect and direct impacts on its biodiversity. The operations investigated include World Bank macro-economic policy advice and traditional investments in infrastructure projects as well as a GEF project specifically designed to protect biodiversity. The central finding of this research is that the institutions comply only partially and in an uneven manner with their own mandatory policy guidelines. In order to mitigate the risk of studying the institutions' operations in only one country and to ascertain possible systemic patterns of institutional behaviour, the results of the case studies are contrasted with the institutions internal evaluation reports covering their overall portfolios. A political ecology approach to international financial institutions is used to examine the political factors behind the emergence of the institutions' biodiversity agenda and the implementation of their operational policies. Analytical tools from both political science and the areas of sociology and economics concerned with theory of organization are employed to further the understanding of the functioning of the global institutions. Finally, the thesis seeks to contribute to defining the characteristics of global institutions which can mediate between the global and local levels by creating spaces of negotiation in which a plurality of views are taken into account.","citation":"Korinna Horta (2000)","page":1}

literature has emerged on the definition, measurement, and analysis of poverty. Much of this literature focuses on analyzing poverty at the national level, or spatial disaggregation by general categories of urban or rural areas, with adjustments made for regional price differentials. Yet for an individual city attempting to tackle the problems of urban poverty, this level of aggregation is not sufficient for answering specific questions such as where the poor are located in the city, whether there are differences between poor areas, if access to services varies by subgroup, whether specific programs are reaching the poorest, and how to design effective poverty reduction programs and policies. Answering these questions is critical, particularly for large, sprawling cities with highly diverse populations and growing problems of urban poverty. Understanding urban poverty presents a set of issues distinct from general poverty analysis and thus may require additional tools and techniques. Baker and Schuler summarize the main issues in conducting urban poverty analysis, with a focus on presenting a sample of case studies from urban areas that were implemented by a number of different agencies using a range of analytical approaches for studying urban poverty. Specific conclusions regarding design and analysis, data, timing, cost, and implementation issues are discussed. This paper—a product of the Urban Unit, Transport and Urban Development Department—is part of a larger effort in the department to promote strategies for reducing urban poverty.

paper argues that decentralization is a precondition for co-management. However, it is not self-sufficient and there should be an incentive mechanism established through a multilevel decentralization in order for local people to participate. When decentralization at multilevel is applied to co-management for protected areas, its success depends on the participation of all parties based on incentive mechanisms specified. Recent government decentralization in Indonesia is a case in point. Central government has made itself ready for partnership with all levels of governments down to communities by adopting a decentralization policy. However, these opportunities are taken with reluctance by local governments considering the cost they would have to bear, and the decentralization process does not extend beyond the district administration level. We analyze these issues by examining the Barisan I Nature Reserve management in West Sumatra, which straddles four autonomous districts. Different initiatives have been taken by district governments and local communities in protecting this area after the implementation of government decentralization. The study findings support the argument that, if decentralized district governance mechanisms support local communities with additional incentives beyond traditional incentives, concerned stakeholders take an active role in managing their protected areas, thus forming a system of co-management. In addition, the paper proposes an alternative model of co-management. This is based on local incentives and emphasizes that environmental and ecological benefits ensue if a protected area adopts multilevel decentralization down to the village level.

is one important reason for the impressive growth of pharmaceutical, chemical and agro-industry in this century. \"Patents\" from nature and the ethnological knowledge linked to their use in day-to-day life have inspired generations of inventors to create a vast array of products ranging from Aspirin to Bacillus thuringensis and Phosphinothricin to Zocor, some of which generate annual sales of more than US$ 1 billion. Biodiversity's genetic potential for biotechnology might be even greater, and products like tissue plasminogen activator from vampire bats, or high-laurate canola oil from rape seed transformed with a gene from an undomesticated Californian bay will soon be available on the market. Some of these new products might pose a threat to biodiversity or to the economies of tropical and subtropical countries, as in the case of Calgene's high-laurate canola oil which can substitute coconut and palm kernel oil. The research agreement between INBio and Merck, Sharp & Dohme acknowledges that biodiversity can be used for product development in a sustainable manner and thus conserved for future generations. Royalty obligations on net sales of future pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, fragrances and biotech products to finance conservation measures comprise only a minor fraction of potential benefits which might contribute to maintaining biological diversity and variability. Even more important are the contributions that capacity building and technology transfer can make to the scientific and technological development of biodiversity-rich countries. Fair research partnerships between source countries and industry and academic institutions in industrialised countries are necessary. National scientists must spend more time investigating biodiversity, both at the basic research level and in the development of new products. The use of biological diversity for socioeconomic development is an important goal for Costa Rica, and INBio is making a significant contribution to this process.","citation":"Werner Nader & Nicolas Mateo (2001)","page":1}

1996 annual Worldwatch Institute report continues to describe trends that will shape the future of the world. 33 key indicators during 1950-95 and an additional 12 new indicators provide a view of ecological economic and social forces affecting the world. The special new indicators include pesticide control organic farming environmental taxes private financing in the Third World insurance deforestation aquatic species loss environmental treaties infectious diseases landmines domestic violence and voters. Among the new trends is the increase in infectious diseases such as cholera diphtheria and malaria and the loss or endangerment of 20% of all fish species. There are 110 million landmines in 64 countries. These instruments of terrorism more so than instruments of war continue to proliferate. Insurance claims for weather-related disasters have risen in number and cost. New bans on pesticides that migrate into the marine environment were introduced. New provisions concerned with fishing on the high seas among 30 countries were added to the original Law of the Sea in December 1995. The Berlin Mandate on Climate Change aims for an agreement within 2 years on targets for greenhouse gas emissions after 2000 for industrialized countries. Members of the Montreal protocol agreed to phase out ozone-depleting methyl bromide use in industrial countries by 2010 and to accelerate the phasing out of hydrofluorocarbons. Agreement was reached on beginning work on a protocol for controlling the transboundary movement of living organisms modified through biotechnology and on biodiversity in coastal and marine ecosystems and in forests. The Basel Convention on hazardous waste was changed to include an outright ban on trade in hazardous wastes. Violence against women in the form of son preference wife beating female genital mutilation murder and rape continues to occur when male dominance is institutionalized in social political and economic systems. Key indicators such as the grain harvest declined and global temperature rose.","citation":"Brown Lr et al. (1996)","page":1}

Abstract Governmental interventions that set out to improve the world are assembled from diverse elements – discourses, institutions, forms of expertise and social groups whose deficiencies need to be corrected, among others. In this article I advance an analytic that focuses on practices of assemblage – the on-going labour of bringing disparate elements together and forging connections between them. I identify six practices that are generic to any assemblage, whatever its specific contours: 1) forging alignments, 2) rendering technical, 3) authorizing knowledge, 4) managing failures, 5) anti-politics, and 6) reassembling. I demonstrate the power of this analytic through an extended study of community forest management. This is an assemblage that brings together an array of agents (villagers, labourers, entrepreneurs, officials, activists, aid donors, scientists) and objectives (profit, pay, livelihoods, control, property, efficiency, sustainability, conservation). Its very unwieldiness helps to sharpen analysis of how such an assemblage is, in fact, assembled, and how it has been sustained for more than thirty years, absorbing hundreds of millions of dollars in programmes from the west coast of Canada to the eastern islands of Indonesia. I do not attempt to adjudicate the rights and wrongs of this assemblage. Rather, I deploy an analytic of assemblage to explore the practices that fill the gap between the will to govern and the refractory processes that make government so difficult.

For an outline of the concept of government as the ‘conduct of conduct’ and intervention in the relations between ‘men and things’ to secure the welfare of the population, see Foucault (1991 Foucault, M. 1991. “‘Governmentality’”. In The Foucault Effect: Studies in Governmentality, Edited by: Burchell, G., Gordon, C. and Miller, P. Chicago, IL: University of Chicago Press. [Google Scholar]). See also Dean (1999), Gordon (1991 Gordon, C. 1991. “‘Governmental rationality: an introduction’”. In The Foucault Effect: Studies in Governmentality, Edited by: Burchell, G., Gordon, C. and Miller, P. Chicago, IL: University of Chicago Press. [Google Scholar]) and Rose 1999). I explore ‘the will to improve’ in Li (2007). 3. Barry (2001 Barry, A. 2001. Political Machines: Governing a Technological Society, London: Athlone. [Google Scholar]: 10–11, 218, fn. 38) similarly stresses agency, process and emergence over the kind of completed order suggested by Foucault's term dispositif. See the extended ethnographic treatment of assemblage as emergence in Moore (2005 Moore, D. 2005. Suffering for Territory: Race, Place, and Power in Zimbabwe, Durham, NC: Duke University Press. [Crossref] , [Google Scholar]). 4. See Rose (1999 Rose, N. 1999. Powers of Freedom: Reframing Political Thought, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. [Crossref] , [Google Scholar]: 19) and Dean (1999 Dean, M. 1999. Governmentality: Power and Rule in Modern Society, London: Sage. [Google Scholar]: 31). In Li (2007 Li, T. M. 2007. The Will to Improve: Governmentality, Development, and the Practice of Politics, Durham, NC: Duke University Press. [Crossref] , [Google Scholar]) I argue for bringing studies of government into dialogue with histories and sociologies of rule without collapsing one into the other. My argument builds upon those of Clarke (2004 Clarke, J. 2004. Changing Welfare, Changing States: New Directions in Social Policy, London: Sage. [Google Scholar]) and O'Malley et al. (1997 O'Malley, P., Weir, L. and Shearing, C. 1997. ‘Governmentality, criticism, politics’. Economy and Society, 26: 501–17. [Taylor & Francis Online], [Web of Science ®] , [Google Scholar]) who critique the neglect of practice and instability in studies of government. 5. Rose (1999 Rose, N. 1999. Powers of Freedom: Reframing Political Thought, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. [Crossref] , [Google Scholar]: 48) calls this process ‘translation’, a term that suggests the uni-directional conversion of something that is fixed. I prefer ‘forging alignments’, which leaves open the question of how lines are adjusted to accommodate divergent agendas. See O'Malley (1996 O'Malley, P. 1996. ‘Indigenous governance’. Economy and Society, 25: 310–26. [Taylor & Francis Online], [Web of Science ®] , [Google Scholar]) and Li (1999 Li, T. M. 1999. ‘Compromising power: development, culture and rule in Indonesia’. Cultural Anthropology, 14: 1–28. [Crossref] , [Google Scholar]) for empirical studies of how programmes were altered by their ‘target groups’. 6. See Rose (1999 Rose, N. 1999. Powers of Freedom: Reframing Political Thought, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. [Crossref] , [Google Scholar]: 33) on the bounding and dissecting of a technical domain. 7.

For a helpful discussion of changing concepts of agency in the earlier and later Foucault, see Dupont and Pearce (2001 Dupont, D. and Pearce, F. 2001. ‘Foucault contra Foucault: rereading the “governmentality” papers’. Theoretical Criminology, 5: 123–58. [Crossref], [Web of Science ®] , [Google Scholar]: 144). 10. Scott (1998 Scott, J. C. 1998. Seeing Like a State: How Certain Schemes to Improve the Human Condition Have Failed, New Haven, CT: Yale University Press. [Google Scholar]) outlines the combination of utopic dreams and concentrated powers under which high modern schemes emerged. I situate Scott's approach in relation to studies of governmentality in Li (2005 Li, T. M. 2005. ‘Beyond “the state” and failed schemes’. American Anthropologist, 107: 383–94. [Crossref], [Web of Science ®] , [Google Scholar]). Compare Cruikshank (1999 Cruikshank, B. 1999. The Will to Empower: Democratic Citizens and Other Subjects, Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press. [Crossref] , [Google Scholar]: 42) on government as an accretion of ‘small things’ rather than totalizing systems. Karl Polanyi neatly captured the contrast when he argued that the creation of an unfettered market for land and labour in the nineteenth century was a grand utopian scheme – ideologically driven then as it is in its contemporary neo-liberal guise. Yet the array of interventions needed to keep populations alive and productive under market conditions emerged in piecemeal and pragmatic fashion: ‘Laissez-faire was planned’, he argued, ‘planning was not’ (Polanyi 1957 Polanyi , K.

I make this argument in the context of Indonesia in Li (2001). 33. The World Bank's new version of the programme has attempted to correct the problem, apparently without success (World Rainforest Movement 2005). 34. The Joint Forest Management programme in India has received massive donor investments, mainly in the form of loan funds from the World Bank (Sundar 2000 Sundar, N. 2000. ‘Unpacking the “joint” in joint forest management’.

[Google Scholar]). In Francophone West Africa a similar approach, known as ‘gestion des terroires’ (territorial management), has been widely pursued. There have been forty projects covering 2500 villages at a cost of US$280 million in Burkina Faso alone (Batterbury 1998 Batterbury, S. 1998. ‘Local environmental management, land degradation and the “gestion des terroirs” approach in West Africa: policies and pitfalls’.

An evaluation of the community management programme of Canada's International Development Research Center applauds its provision of well-documented case studies of pilot projects as ‘learning opportunities’ that prove ‘the validity of the concept’ and demonstrate to policy-makers that alternatives to (failed) state management do exist (Gonsalves and Mendoza 2003 Gonsalves , J. and Mendoza , L. ( 2003 ) External Review of IDRC's Community-based Natural Resource Management (CBNRM) Program Initiative (PI) in Asia, Final Report , International Development Research Centre. [Google Scholar]: 4). The authors note that the programme has not yet produced policy shifts or commitments by government agencies to scale up pilot projects, although they expect this ‘pay off’ to occur in future years (Gonsalves and Mendoza 2003: 14, 28, 37, 41). Nowhere do they raise the possibility that existing state management regimes serve vested interests. All that is lacking for improved management is perfected technique, generated in projects and packaged in ‘methods briefs’ and ‘policy briefs’ (see Gonsalves and Mendoza 2003: 24–5, 38). Fairhead and Leach (2003: 48) also note the intrinsic anti-politics of donor-sponsored ‘projects’ that supply resources without threatening entrenched interests. 36. Fairhead and Leach (2003: 150) describe donors’ narration of their role in protecting forest villagers from corrupt state foresters. 37. Ford's work on community management in India was dominated by an ‘exemplary place’ – a village called Sukhomajri in which the model was perfected. The model proved very expensive to create and maintain and could not be replicated in large part because the state bureaucracy saw little to gain from it. The institutional imperatives of the village were studied exhaustively, but those of the state apparatus were overlooked. See Baviskar and Saberwal (2002: 54–9). 38. ‘Reform’ signals the period that began in 1998 with the resignation of Suharto, president for thirty-two years. Decentralization of control over natural resources to hundreds of district governments was a measure introduced by his successor, Habibie, with donor support. 39. Fairhead and Leach (2003: 101–5) describe a corralled consultation process convened by Conservation International that was set up to confirm prior framings, although various sets of participants ‘saw through’ the process leaving it unclear whether ‘consensus and support’ had in fact been produced. 40.

The region of Lac Lobeke is situated in the Congo Basin, in southeastern Cameroon. The Baka pygmies and several Bantu-speaking groups have lived here for centuries by agriculture, and hunting, fishing and collecting a great variety of forest products. The degradation and threat to biodiversity started with the arrival of German colonialists at the end of the nineteenth century. The colonisers provided incentives for the commercialisation of ivory, wood and non-timber forest products (NTFP), such as gum and strophantus. In the 1960s, international logging companies acquired concessions for logging, initiating an even more rapid process of environmental degradation and destruction. According to the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF), about 60 percent of the timber exported by Cameroon comes from illegal logging (Usongo June 2000). Additionally, easier access to the deeper forests and better transport conditions led to an increase in poaching of wildlife to such an extent that nowadays the biodiversity of the region is in very great danger. After the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro in 1992 the World Bank created several conservation projects in the Congo Basin that prioritise global preservation in this region, since it represents the second largest area of tropical forest in the world. One of these projects was the `Project for Protection and Management of the Biodiversity of Southeast Cameroon'. This is financed by the Global Environment Facility (GEF), coordinated by the Ministry of Forestry of Cameroon, with technical support from the Deutsche Gesellschaft fur Technische Zusammenarbeit (GTZ) and the WWF. The aims of the project are the establishment of a regional development plan, including the Protected Areas (PAs), community hunting zones and other multiple zones. The WWF is committed to elaborating management plans for two future Protected Areas. One of the concepts envisaged for the management of the PAs is collaborative management. The aim is to involve the local population in decision making, monitoring and benefit sharing, in order to ensure an efficient protection of biodiversity and sustainable local development. In the following paragraphs we describe the relationship of the local population to their habitat. The agriculture, fishing, collecting and income needs in general are focused upon. Then the informal and formal property rights, such as the stakeholders involved in the collaborative management, are analysed. Finally, we discuss the potentials and constraints of a collaborative approach for the management of the National Park Lac Lobeke. (1) The Concept of Co-management Defining collaborative management Collaborative management--or, in short, co-management--consists, according to Townsend and Pooley (1995), of any set of institutional arrangements between relevant stakeholders that structure an external relationship for resource governance. As such, it has to be distinguished from an internal structure which is, for instance, found in a `pure' common property regime. Borrini-Feyerabend (1996: 17) has pointed out that collaborative management is not a tightly defined concept and that the term is used for a variety of institutional arrangements, ranging between mere consultation and the transfer of decision-making authority. Borrini-Feyerabend et al. (2000) define co-management as a situation in which two or more social actors negotiate, define and guarantee amongst themselves a fair sharing of the management functions, entitlements and responsibilities for a given territory, area or set of natural resources. The social actors, or stakeholders, primarily include the agency in charge (usually a state agency) and various associations of local residents and resource users. However, co-management can also involve non-governmental organisations, local administrations, traditional authorities, research institutions, business and others. Meinzen-Dick and Knox (1999) place co-management in the context of devolution, and distinguish collaborative management, wherein the state retains a role in resource management, from community-based resource management, wherein control over resources is transferred more or less completely to local user groups. …","citation":"Britta Jell & Jutta Schmidt Machado (2002)","page":1}

Areas in the Mediterranean significantly contribute to sustaining the economy of the region. Covering around 300,000 Km2, they provide freshwater flows, resources for hydropower, recreation and tourism, fisheries, biodiversity, and other ecosystem services. Regional assessments have concluded that a major effort needs to be made to solve their state of chronic under-funding. The Murcia Conference on Protected Areas in the Mediterranean and the Vth World Parks Congress, identified a wide range of alternatives for generating revenues, emphasizing the need to develop innovative funding approaches such as debt swaps, endowment funds, and payment for ecosystem services; to improve development policies (e.g. by reforming subsidies); and to share costs and benefits through co-management and local participation. In this paper we review the degree of implementation of the recommendations for the Mediterranean, assessing the general financing needs and gaps, the main funding sources, and identifying the most important financing actions.","citation":"Arturo López Ornat & Sira Jiménez-Caballero (2006)","page":1}

document presents the proceedings of a one-day Workshop on Investing in Biodiversity Conservation held at the Inter-American Development Bank in Washington, D.C., on October 28, 1996. The first part of the workshop was dedicated to the presentation of key topics on biodiversity financing by five leaders in the field. The second part of the workshop was dedicated to a discussion and exchange of ideas on the role of the IDB in investing in biodiversity conservation. Three main recommendations emerged: 1) The Bank should prepare a report on on its experience in biodiversity projects and development programs with biodiversity components; 2) A task force should be formed to work on a bio-diversity policy or strategy; 3) IDB staff should be trained to understand the biodiversity concept and its implications in project preparation and implementation.","citation":"Jeffrey A.

the applications of noncooperative bargaining theory to water related issues-which fall in the category of formal models of negotiation. They aim to identify the conditions under which agreements are likely to emerge and their characteristics, to support policymakers in devising the \" rules of the game \" that could help obtain a desired result. Despite the fact that allocation of natural resources, especially trans-boundary allocation, has all the characteristics of a negotiation problem, there are not many applications of formal negotiation theory to the issue. Therefore, the authors first discuss the noncooperative bargaining models applied to water allocation problems found in the literature. Key findings include the important role noncooperative negotiations can play in cases where binding agreements cannot be signed; the value added of politically and socially acceptable compromises; and the need for a negotiated model that considers incomplete information over the negotiated resource.

survey and inventory of tree canopy bio-diversity for cryptogams (myxomycetes, macrofungi, mosses, liverworts, lichens and ferns) in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park resulted in the discovery of an undescribed myxomycete species. This taxon is classified in the order Physarales, family Di-dymiaceae and genus Diachea. A combination of morphological characteristics distinguishes Diachea arboricola H.W. Keller & M. Skrabal sp. nov. from all other species in the genus: peridium iridescent gold to silvery gray; stalk reddish orange above and whitish below, filled with crystals; capillitial threads stiff, dichotomously branched and arising from the tip of the columella; spore ornamentation uniformly covering the entire spore surface, appearing spiny with light microscopy, with scanning electron microscopy as vertical processes with capitate, clustered, spike-like tips. This type of spore ornamentation has not been found in any other Diachea species. Diachea arboricola is known only from the tree canopy, ranging in height from roughly 3 to 21 m, on three tree species, Fraxinus americana, Juniperus virginiana and Quercus alba. Observations of plasmodial growth and fruiting body development are described based on moist chamber cultures. Tree canopy observations in situ suggest that the plasmodium of this species migrates over extensive vertical areas of tree bark. Ecological factors are discussed that include pH of bark substrata. The species description is based on abundant sporangia from 17 different collections. A key to the species of Diachea is provided to aid in the identification of this taxon.KeywordsbiodiversityDiacheaecologyGreat Smoky Mountains National ParkMyxomycetesslime moldtree canopy James Counts, Laura Henley, Damon Lesmeister, Danny Pacholski, Melissa Skrabal and Kenny Snell were student tree climbers from Central Missouri State University who collected samples from the tree canopy.

diplomacy can be defined as the method by which states conduct their external economic relations. It embraces how they make decisions domestically, how they negotiate internationally and how the two processes interact. Economic diplomacy has been transformed in the last two decades with the end of the Cold War and the advance of globalization. Its subject matter has become much wider and more varied and it has penetrated more deeply into domestic politics--no longer being limited to measures imposed at the border. Internationally, it engages a far larger range of countries, including rising powers like China, India and Brazil. Yet the relative power and resources of governments have been shrinking, so that they often seem to be trying to do more with less. (1) Governments have adopted four broad strategies to meet the demands made on its economic diplomacy. They involve ministers--i.e, cabinet-rank politicians--far more alongside bureaucrats. They try to get non-state actors, like private firms or civil society bodies, to share its burdens. They encourage greater transparency to widen understanding and support. They use international institutions to advance domestic as well as external aims and to make the system more inclusive. In many areas of economic diplomacy, notably international trade and the global environment, these strategies yielded major advances in the 1990s. The World Trade Organization (WTO)--in operation since 1995--embraced all trade, including agriculture, services and intellectual property, engaged virtually all countries and went deeply into domestic policy, as well as introducing judicial settlement of trade disputes. In 1992, the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development launched a series of binding treaties on issues like climate change and biodiversity with global institutions in support. This would have been inconceivable during the Cold War. Financial diplomacy--a subset of economic diplomacy--changed more slowly. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank, while not achieving universal membership, remained the dominant institutions. A major upheaval came with the Asian financial crises that began in 1997 in Thailand, Indonesia and South Korea and proved highly contagious, spreading far beyond East Asia. Previous financial crises, up to the Mexican Financial Crisis of 1994, had been caused by the imprudence of governments. This time, the crisis was provoked by the private sector. The three Asian countries in question were pursuing sound fiscal policies and their main mistake was to fix their currencies to the U.S. dollar, which was falling. This encouraged irresponsible financial behaviour by local borrowers and Western lenders, which became a disaster when the dollar began to strengthen. (2) Resolution of this last financial crisis of the 20th century followed the usual pattern. The finance ministers of the Group of Seven (G-7) countries, led by the United States, encouraged the IMF to mount rescue packages linked to policy reforms. (3) The G-7 then worked out proposals for new international financial to be adopted by the IMF and the World Bank and to prevent the recurrence of similar problems. The process was interrupted in 1998 by Russia's default and capital flight from Brazil, but the architecture was finally agreed upon by the IMF and the World Bank in 1999. (4) Many of the agreed policy measures fell short of their promise, but the institutional changes were valuable. The IMF's ministerial committee was formalized as the International Monetary and Financial Committee (IMFC). The Financial Stability Forum (FSF) was created to provide multilateral surveillance of financial regulators. A grouping of finance ministers, the Group of Twenty (G-20), successfully associated the emerging powers like Brazil, China, India and South Africa with the original G-7. (5) After the advances of the 1990s, however, the 2000s have been disappointing for trade and environmental diplomacy. …","citation":"Nicholas Bayne (2008)","page":1}

governance frequently represents a leading edge of global regulation. This is perhaps nowhere more evident than in the climate regime, which has continued to create new modes of regulation despite negotiation impasse. Yet, these new initiatives, like existing legal approaches to environmental challenges, too often embrace a fragmented view of issue areas and fail to reflect fundamental connections between the objects of regulation. Climate regime regulatory innovation also appears to be increasingly limited by the shortcomings of a purely state-driven international approach to global environmental governance, which has long been obvious in other areas (most prominently, the tropical forest context). Private networks play an increasingly important role in global environmental governance, as illustrated most directly by forest certification that was developed to fill a gap left by forest-related negotiation failures of the 1990s. These prior forest negotiation failures also laid the groundwork for tropical forests to become an object of climate regime regulation, giving rise to one of the most promising programs for developing issue-linkage in global environmental governance. The reduced emissions from deforestation and degradation (REDD) program holds out the promise of not only reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the forest sector, but also promoting public goods associated with biodiversity and human well-being. Despite its promise, REDD remains incompletely formed and fragile. Moreover, it faces the prospect of suffering from an issue-fragmentation that values forests only for their carbon and restricting itself through purely state-based administration. In response to this concern and the need for greater recognition of issue-linkages in designing global environmental regulation generally, this Article proposes a hybrid public-private governance approach to REDD that can encourage maximum emissions reductions while also effectively promoting a broad array of benefits for biodiversity and human well-being. In so doing, the Article also offers a concomitant and generalizable model for combining private market finance and public funding to increase the coherence and effectiveness of global environmental regulation.","citation":"Andrew Long (2010)","page":1}

political developments and academic debate indicate that future political commitment to the protection of natural resources is uncertain. This political uncertainty is particularly problematic when the danger of irreversible damage such as the extinction of species looms. Accordingly, policies are needed which can ward off such damage. This paper analyses a particular policy regarding a situation where the survival of an endangered species depends on certain types of biodiversity-enhancing land-use measures being carried out regularly, yet due to uncertain political commitment the periodical availability of a budget to finance these measures is not guaranteed. To insure against future underfunding for conservation, a fund is established which allows money to be saved for conservation in later periods. To maximise the long-term survival of the endangered species, it has to be decided in each period whether to spend the available money now or to allocate it to the fund for future use. The paper provides an ecological-economic model for this dynamic optimisation problem.","citation":"Martin Drechsler & Frank Wätzold (2003)","page":1}

order to obtain mining land reclamation scheme reasonably, the matter element model was proposed. The divergence which is the character of matter element model was used to design land reclamation schemes. The of land reclamation matter element model are nature state, geology structure, reclamation process, mining subsidence state, present mining condition financing. At first, the author applied the divergence of matter element to establish scheme collection. Then qualified schemes are selected preliminarily according to the known value. The following step is establishing another appraisal matter element model, which eigenvalues are land production, cost, farmer per enhancive income, ecosystem stability, biodiversity, landscape diversity. In the appraisal matter element, Shannon index reflects biodiversity and affinity analysis reflects landscape diversity. Through the appraisal matter element model dependent function between preliminarily schemes was set up. Finally, the most excellent one is selected by the optimal appraisal method.

total area of woodland in Great Britain (GB) is 2.7 m hectares of which one‐third is State‐owned and two‐thirds private; total annual wood production approximates 12 m cubic meters, while total imports of forest products approximate 48 m cubic meters. Public and government interest in forests and woodlands is significant and growing. However, support for four long‐established forestry educational institutions is diminishing accompanied by a decline in the number of applicants for university and college places in forestry courses (325 in 1996 to 156 in 2003). At the same time, there is an increase in the number of institutions (44 in 2004) offering forestry‐related subjects at postgraduate, undergraduate and technical levels although many of these are minor components within wider courses of anthropology, biology, conservation, development studies, environmental studies, geography and zoology. While these are laudable, there is concern within the forestry profession at the potential decline in education for integrated resource management. Partly to fill this gap, a number of organizations offer short, intensive, professional courses while many industrial companies provide in‐service training. In the UK at least 20 government and non‐government organizations finance over 520 forestry‐related research projects each year. The research is conducted by a large number of government institutions, conservation bodies and universities. The total financial support over the last five years has approximated £ 23 m but the low priority given to forestry in Framework Programme 6 of the EU is likely to lead to a decline in funding unless future EU Framework Programmes recognize the importance of forestry. Recent changes in priorities have resulted in more research on biodiversity, conservation, short rotation coppice and climate change together with wood utilization and overall sustainability.","citation":"Jeffery Burley et al.

represent an extraordinary reservoir of novel molecules and currently there is a renewed interest in plant kingdom as a source of novel lead compounds for screening libraries. The flora of Panama is one of the richest in the world, whose medical and economic potential has not been fully explored. Results from multinational projects financed by the Organization of American States, European Union, International Foundation for Science, CYTED Program, and International Biodiversity Cooperative Groups (ICBG) reveal that the Panamanian flora is undoubtedly a valuable source of lead molecules for the pharmaceutical industry. Historical development and the current status of pharmacognostic research on Panamanian flora carried out during the last 30 years are presented. Specifically, ethnobotanical inventories of three Amerindians groups Kuna, Ngobe-Bugle and Teribes (Naso), pharmacological evaluation of plants used in folk medicine and screening of plants for anticancer, antifungal and antiparasitic activities and isolation and characterization of bioactive compounds are described. To date over 390 compounds have been isolated from the Panamanian Flora, of which 111 are new to world literature.","citation":"Mahabir P. Gupta (2004)","page":1}

present study investigates the potential for direct payment for biodiversity conservation implementation in the Congo Basin. A survey realized in 31 protected areas in the Congo Basin showed that some initiatives, starting with raising awareness, are used to raise local participation in conservation, but there are very few conservation agreements with local people. Attempt to biodiversity conservation in/around PAs is done through three main approaches. Indirect incentive approaches are the most used (63%) in front of direct incentives for sustainable biodiversity use (30%). Direct incentives for biodiversity conservation (7%) are quite new and are still not bound by conservation contracts. Five initiatives are being implemented including rewards for denunciating poachers (in 2 PAs), conservation of marine turtles in Campo Ma?an TUO, compensation of farmers for damages caused by wildlife in their farmland and paying a local community to set aside an area as no man?s land for carbon sequestration evaluation. Three other initiatives are still in their planning phase. They are conservation concession projects proposed by conservation organizations (WWF, CI and BCI) to governments of Cameroon, CAR and DRC. Use-restriction on some elements of the biodiversity like wildlife is likely to be the best PES scheme in the Congo Basin compared to area-based schemes, since people heavily depend on land for their livelihood. The success of the conservation contracts will depend on securing property rights, a careful evaluation of opportunity costs considering ways and customs of local people, a clear definition of indicators (people efforts and results), a democratic and equitable use of compensation funds and an establishment of a strong institutional framework and monitoring authority for contract enforcement. All this may involve high transaction costs to improve efficiency of payments. Conservation contracts in the Congo Basin may not be such a cheap way to achieve biodiversity conservation as thought by many conservationists. A part from biodiversity market, possible mechanisms to finance them can be Trust fund for PA management and the future REDD mechanism. Finally, government efforts in clarification of customary rights will be required.

decision model for the efficient management of a conservation fund over time.— An important task of conservation biology is to assist policy makers in the design of ecologically effective conservation strategies and instruments. Various decision rules and guidelines originate, e.g., from the Theory of Island Biography (MacArthur &amp; Wilson, 1967) and metapopulation theory (Hanski, 1999). Designing effective strategies and instruments, however, is only part of the solution to problems of biodiversity conservation. In the real world, financial resources are scarce, and it is not only important that policies are ecologically effective but also that they are economically efficient, i.e. lead to maximum ecological benefit for a given resource input. Efficiency has been analysed, e.g. in the context of the spatial allocation of conservation funds (Wu &amp; Bogess, 1999) and of the spatial design of compensation payments for biodiversity enhancing land–use measures (Wätzold &amp; Drechsler, 2002). Decision analysis is a helpful tool for integrating knowledge from different disciplines and identifying optimal strategies and policies (e.g., Drechsler &amp; Burgman, 2003). Methods of decision analysis, such as optimisation procedures, are often a core component of ecological–economic models that bring together ecological and economic knowledge via formal models (e.g., Ando et al., 1998, Drechsler &amp; Wätzold, 2001, Johst et al., 2002). Such models do not only allow a static integration of economic and ecological aspects but also to describe the dynamics of ecological and economic systems in an integrated manner (Perrings, 2002). Examples of such dynamic modelling approaches are Richards et al. (1999), Costello &amp; Polasky (2003) and Shogren et al. (2003). In the present paper we investigate a dynamic conservation management problem different from those of the above mentioned authors and tackle the problem of long–term conservation when future financial budgets are uncertain. The background for this problem is that many species can only survive if certain types of biodiversity–enhancing land–use measures are carried out on a regular basis, such as regularly mowing meadows to create habitat for butterflies (Settele &amp; Henle, 2002). This means that funds have to be regularly available over time, because a temporal gap in the availability of funds may irrevocably drive a species to extinction. While over the last two decades or so a growing commitment of society and governments to conserve biodiversity could be observed, that in many cases also included the increasing provision of funds for this purpose, there are signs that this commitment is currently weakening. An example of such signs are opinion polls in some countries (e.g. Germany) showing that environmental and resource protection issues are given a lower priority by the general public than ten years ago. This implies that there is an increasing risk that conservation funds will be lower in the future than today either through a decrease in political support for such funds or through a decline in donations for private organisations that finance conservation funds....","citation":"Martin Drechsler & Frank Wätzold (2004)","page":1}

major overhaul to the World Bank's past estimates of global poverty, incorporating new and better data. Extreme poverty-as judged by what \"poverty\" means in the world's poorest countries-is found to be more pervasive than we thought. Yet the data also provide robust evidence of continually declining poverty incidence and depth since the early 1980s. For 2005 we estimate that 1.4 billion people, or one quarter of the population of the developing world, lived below our international line of $1.25 a day in 2005 prices; 25 years earlier there were 1.9 billion poor, or one half of the population. Progress was uneven across regions. The poverty rate in East Asia fell from 80% to under 20 percent over this period. By contrast it stayed at around 50 percent in Sub-Saharan Africa, though with signs of progress since the mid 1990s. Because of lags in survey data availability, these estimates do not yet reflect the sharp rise in food prices since 2005.

new Companies Act 61 of 2008 incorporates into statute for the first time issues of corporate governance. Governance, strategy and sustainability have become inseparable. This is so because of the ecological and biodiversity crisis on planet earth. This leads to the King III recommendation of integrated reporting, namely, a holistic and integrated representation of the company's performance in terms of both its finance and its sustainability. The new Act has a chapter on accountability and transparency and includes setting out the director's duties of good faith, care, skill and diligence. The Companies Tribunal will carry out, by way of voluntary alternative dispute resolution, reviews of administrative decisions made by the Commission, in line with the international emerging governance trend of mediation and arbitration clauses in major procurement contracts. Internal audit is now risk-centric and advises the board on the adequacy and effectiveness of internal controls. IT governance and IT security are now pervasive in the business of a company and dealt with in King III. Company law sets the framework in which the company operates and the recommended practices set out in King III provide guidance for directors as to how they should direct the business of the company and make decisions on behalf of the company. In this sense, the new Act and King III complement each other.","citation":"Mervyn E. King (2010)","page":1}

cost of protecting a wetland and its biodiversity from the adverse impacts of development is an important input into the choice between development alternatives and into negotiations on sharing the cost of such protection. Although the concept of incremental cost has long been used in economics, finance and business to help decision-makers choose applied to environmental decision-making. This publication illustrates how the incremental cost of development to protect the functions and benefits of wetlands should between alternatives, it is only since Agenda 21, the Convention on Biological Diversity, and the Global Environment Facility gave it prominence that it has been systematically be compared to the consequences of development that provides no protection. Incremental cost is the cost of a decision to do one thing instead of another. Here is it the additional cost, relative to a baseline course of action affecting a wetland, of a decision to adopt a different course of action that not only meets the original national priorities but also protects biodiversity. This book has two introductory chapters, Biodiversity and the Global Significance of Asian Wetlands and Incremental Costs of Conserving Wetland Biodiversity, complemented by four case studies from the Asia-Pacific region.","citation":"Wim Giesen et al.

The distribution of predatory soil nematodes (Mononchida) across Europe is well described. However, in Ireland knowledge of mononchids is limited to a single study. The CréBeo project was the first systematic survey of soil biodiversity in the major land-use types across the Republic of Ireland. Nematodes were sampled from 61 locations with an extensive geographical spread including arable, pasture, broadleaf forest, coniferous plantation, rough grazing and peatland sites. This study resulted in 11 first records of mononchid species from Ireland (of which 2 are new records for Britain and Ireland). We discuss the mononchid species found and aspects of their distribution across major land uses. Keywords: Anatonchus sympathicus biodiversity Jensenonchus sphagni species distribution Tigronchoides ginglymodontus Acknowledgements We thank Peter Mullin, Christina Hazard, Dillon Finan, Bas Boots and Fintan Bracken for assistance in field sampling, and members of the Soil-C team (University College Cork) for provision of soils data. This study was funded by the Environmental ERDTI Programme 2000–2006, financed by the Irish Government under the National Development Plan and administered on behalf of the Department of Environment and Local Government by the Environmental Protection Agency (\"CréBeo: Baseline data, response to pressures, functions and conservation of keystone micro- and macro-organisms in Irish soils\", 2005-S-LS-8).","citation":"Aidan M.

the environmental, social, and human damage caused by non-sustainable development, this provocative book provides readers with an incisive and integrated approach to the political, economic, scientific, and technological realities and challenges facing international environmental law and policy today. In addition to an in-depth survey of the past, present, and future of this important and rapidly expanding field, this new book offers innovative chapters on such crucial current imperatives as: the nature and scope of the challenge; first principles of international environmental law; environment and human rights; environment and the nexus of international trade, finance and debt; the unfinished agenda. All the traditional subjects are also covered, including the history of international environmental law, the law of the sea, international freshwater resources, cross-border air pollution, ozone depletion and global warming, the technology of chemicals manufacture and transport, disposal of hazardous waste, preservation of species and biodiversity, environmental impact analysis, and regulation of nuclear energy.","citation":"Ved P.

for environmental services (PES) are a promising mechanism for conservation. PES could either provide additional funding for protected areas, pay land users to conserve biodiversity outside protected areas, or both. For PES to work, it requires a secure long-term source of financing. Obtaining payments directly for biodiversity conservation is difficult, however. In most cases, water users are the most likely such source, either directly or indirectly. Thus the potential for PES to help conserve biodiversity depends, in a large measure, on the degree to which areas of interest for conservation of water services overlap with areas of interest for conservation of biodiversity. This paper examines the extent of such overlap in the case of highland Guatemala. The results show that this potential varies substantially within the country, with some biodiversity conservation priority areas having very good potential for receiving payments, and others little or none. Overall, about a quarter of all biodiversity conservation priority areas have potential for receiving payments. Thus PES is far from being a silver bullet for biodiversity conservation, but it can make a meaningful contribution to this objective.","citation":"Stefano Pagiola et al. (2009)","page":1}

the last 30 years, human appropriation of global renewable resources has accelerated to the point where 35 per cent of the earth's land surface is now in managed agro-ecosystems, consumptive water use consumes between 50 per cent and 85 per cent of freshwater supply and 60 per cent of ecosystem services are utilised in an unsustainable manner. There are virtually no landscapes in which renewable resources are not already fully allocated among different economic and environmental uses. Furthermore, it is increasingly recognised that water availability issues do not exist in isolation but are linked with the related environmental issues of biodiversity preservation, the carbon cycle, soil degradation, and energy use and supply. It is against this background that the sustainable management of water in mining is increasingly developing a strategic viewpoint where water is viewed as a resource within an interconnected landscape, having economic, environmental and social value and providing a range of environmental services in the provision of public and private goods. This paper explores the issues associated with sustainable management of water in mining from a strategic viewpoint. The cumulative impacts of multiple water users, both within and outside the mining sector, is increasingly threatening the security of supply for all users. To quantitatively assess the ‘true’ value of water it is necessary to: • Better understand the science of ecosystem functioning and how human actions impact on environmental processes. • Develop appropriate policy, finance and governance structures to support innovative programs that preserve ecosystem function and services (including market based instruments). • Apply knowledge as interventions across landscapes in ways that maximise benefits and minimise unintended consequences taking into account differences in the value of water among sectors. A strategic viewpoint of water management relies on knowledge to guide decision making that has been acquired at a range of scales from mine site to mining region. This knowledge must be based on rigorous science, sound data and syntheses of different types of information. Strategic management of water resources will better position the industry in terms of understanding the risks posed by complex, interlinked environmental issues that are increasingly impacting on future access to land and renewable resources, including water, thereby ensuring mining's future social licence to operate.","citation":"D.

prominent scientists avidly advocate bioprospecting, the systematic search for new commercial applications for biota, especially hitherto unstudied species, as a mechanism for inducing tropical biodiversity conservation by making it commercially attractive (Wilson; Reid et al., 1993; PAHO, 1996 and Weiss). Bioprospecting’s premise is that nature contains hidden assets of potentially huge, yet unknown magnitude to humankind that can motivate and even finance biodiversity conservation in the tropics. This undiscovered genetic or biochemical information is commonly framed in the context of potential improvements in medicine or food, thus defining a massive global population of potential beneficiaries. It is further argued that bioprospecting can affect social and economic development in developing countries by rewarding biota-rich but income-poor tropical communities that preserve and wisely manage their genetic resources. The premise of bioprospecting, coupled with the claim that practically all of humankind stands to benefit, and perhaps most especially the poorest of the poor, naturally leads to an urgent desire to conserve tropical biodiversity in order to enable discovery, extraction, and value-adding transformation of tropical biota.","citation":"Christopher B.

in the Balance summarises the scientific and economic debate and highlights disagreements about the definitions of biodiversity management objectives. The author goes on to develop an original analytical treatment of the incremental cost financing mechanisms adopted by the Convention on Biological Diversity. Significantly, he undertakes a microeconomic study of land use change in a biosphere reserve in South-East Mexico. Based on an original data set, the author presents a detailed modelling exercise of resource and land use choices at the individual farm level with related projections of the impact at both community and regional levels.

for reducing carbon emissions due to deforestation and degradation (REDD) have garnered considerable global interest and investments. These financial incentives aim to alter the drivers of land use change by reducing opportunity costs of retaining forest cover, and are often promoted as multipartite solutions that not only generate profits and reduce carbon emissions but provide benefits for human development and biodiversity. Currently, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) is debating a post-Kyoto protocol with national or sub-national emission reduction targets. Anticipating the inclusion of REDD in this agreement, &gt;80% of pilot REDD projects are being established in tropical regions (table 1). While the capacity of REDD projects to meet their stated objectives must be assessed post- implementation, land use change models are powerful tools for generating potential outcomes from these pilot initiatives. Table 1. Extent and emissions reductions for all REDD projects as reported by Ecosystem Marketplace, which maintains a comprehensive and up-to-date inventory of REDD projects that are selling credits and/or are verified by a third-party verifier. Adapted from Forest Carbon Portal (2009). Geographical zone Continent Projects (#) Area (km 2 ) Emissions reductions (Mt C) Tropical and Subtropical Africa 2 7750 19.50 Asia 2 8100 109.60 South America 9 183 880 278.24 Temperate Australia 1 14 0.18 North America 1 15 N/A Totals 15 199 759 407.52 In this issue of ERL, Gaveau et al (2009) use a spatially-explicit model to explore the potential of a REDD pilot project in northern Sumatra, Indonesia, to reduce deforestation and conserve orangutan biodiversity. This project is conceived by the Provincial Government of Aceh, financed by Merrill Lynch, and co-managed by carbon trading firm Carbon Conservation and NGO Flora and Fauna International. Project managers estimate CO 2 emissions reductions at 3.4 Mt y -1 over 30 years across a 7500 km 2 area (Forest Carbon Portal 2009). From a time-series of Landsat satellite images, Gaveau et al calculate deforestation rates from 1990–2000 and 2000–2006. They apply these annual rates to deforestation probability maps, generated from forest condition in 2006 and six static spatial variables, to predict potential locations of future deforestation through 2030 under three different scenarios: (i) a business-as- usual with no REDD project; (ii) the current 7500 km 2 project; and (iii) an extensive 65 000 km 2 REDD scheme extending across the Aceh and Sumatra Utara provinces. Gaveau et al 's chief contribution is identifying locations where forest carbon projects potentially have the greatest benefits for forest and orangutan conservation. By processing Landsat satellite imagery – now freely available – with relatively few spatial model inputs, this approach also has great potential for widespread application in tropical countries developing historical deforestation baselines. Yet Landsat satellite data also impose limitations for REDD. For example, Gaveau et al are unable to calculate forest degradation, which is highly problematic both to define and detect with Landsat imagery, yet critical especially in Indonesia with extensive logged forests (Curran et al 2004, Ramankutty et al 2007, Asner et al 2006). Nevertheless, Landsat remains one of the most appropriate satellite data products available for countries calculating previous rates of forest change. Assuming that technical roadblocks to REDD are overcome, another challenge surrounds assessing the feasibility of emission reduction scenarios, including those presented by Gaveau et al . Their estimates show that carbon and biodiversity gains would be 6- to 7-fold greater if the pilot project encompassed the 65 000 km 2 northern Sumatra region. Yet, developers chose to implement this REDD project across 7500 km 2 , ~ 10% of Gaveau et al 's expanded scenario region. If REDD programs are to be realized across large spatial scales (e.g., provinces/states), what factors constrain effective implementation? First, high transaction costs and investment risks appear to be major barriers to establishing carbon concessions across large, heterogeneous regions. Identifying who should receive compensation as well as negotiating transparent and effective payment arrangements, is at best challenging especially with ambiguous land use rights and government jurisdiction in Indonesia (Ebeling and Yasué 2008). Protecting fragmented forests from multiple threats of logging, agriculture, and fire is fraught with complexities; who should be held accountable for defending 65 000 km 2 from fire especially during ENSO- associated droughts (Siegert et al 2001, Langner and Siegert 2008)? REDD's effectiveness will require support from people who live in and near REDD projects; Gaveau et al address only biodiversity and forest loss in their paper, but incorporating the potential effects of REDD programs on livelihoods and social dynamics is one of the most critical components of effective assessments via scenario-building and modeling (Soares-Filho et al 2006). Another major obstacle to establishing REDD across large regions is the opportunity costs of carbon concessions. Recent estimates show that profits from protecting aboveground biomass for carbon payments in Indonesian non-peat forests are far below the benefits garnered from converting these forests to plantation agriculture (Butler et al 2009). Yet in order to mitigate forest conversion as proposed by Gaveau et al , carbon must compete with alternative high-value commodities (e.g., palm oil). Although forest carbon credits currently are traded in voluntary markets, carbon prices are considerably higher in compliance markets than in voluntary markets (World Bank 2008). If the UNFCCC generates consensus in December 2009 incorporating REDD in formal market-based trading mechanisms to meet compliance targets, REDD may become a financially competitive land use option even in highly-threatened lowland forests, including those in northern Sumatra. Ultimately, REDD implementation is an iterative process, requiring regular appraisals and improvements at local (i.e., REDD projects) through international (i.e., UNFCCC) levels. The overarching value of REDD pilot initiatives such as this groundbreaking Aceh project and Gaveau et al 's innovative assessments is to identify suitable approaches as well as shortcomings, allowing revised and refined efforts that will mitigate forest degradation via financial mechanisms. The next iteration of REDD program evaluations will also need to incorporate: (i) empirical measurements of carbon stock change attributed to forest degradation; (ii) evaluations of economic incentives for a diverse suite of agents such as local and urban communities as well as the private sector; and, (iii) explicitly consider the fluctuating price of carbon vis-à-vis competing commodity prices.

discussion paper assesses selected options currently “on the table” in the international debate and the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) negotiations on Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation in Developing Countries (REDD). REDD design options are analyzed with regard to their implications for overall climate change mitigation, biodiversity conservation and equity issues.\r\nFirst of all, it is found that for REDD to be successful it will not be sufficient simply to put a price on forest carbon. Instead, to permanently reduce and stop global deforestation, REDD needs to trigger a change in our dominant human development model, which will require policy reforms and enforcement to prevent markets from driving deforestation. Among other things, this needs to be reflected in the design of a REDD mechanism, which must i) pay heed to the complex task of reducing deforestation, allowing for a flexible,\r\ncountry-specific approach, to ensure broad participation to tackle deforestation on a global scale; ii) address deforestation by integrating REDD into overall development planning, to achieve lasting results and maximize synergies with other development goals; and iii) be consistent with the overall mitigation effort to prevent dangerous climate change.\r\nThe scope of REDD, definitions and several methodological issues will have a decisive influence on the extent of benefits, or in some cases even threats, REDD will have for biodiversity conservation and equitable access to REDD.\r\nThe design of transfer systems at both the international and national level is key to enabling countries to permanently reduce deforestation and forest degradation. To do so, transfer systems must go beyond mere compensation for avoided deforestation. Instead, they must be embedded in overall development planning and engage in providing alternative (at best low-carbon, low-resource) livelihoods. This will require political reforms and investment into other sectors, which may not immediately lead to emission reductions\r\nin the forest sector. Transfers channelled through a REDD offsetting mechanism are less suited to do so unless proper national transfer systems are in place. Alternatively, the Tropical Deforestation Emission Reduction Mechanism (TDERM) Triptych or the Forest Carbon Partnership Facility, the latter complemented by the UN REDD Programme, could be used as a transitional international transfer system for REDD funds in the period 2013– 2020. Given their comprehensive international approach to tackling deforestation, both can be expected to perform better concerning active consideration of human, and especially indigenous people’s rights, and delivery of benefits other than carbon retention. It is safe to assume that REDD in the period 2013–2020 will require several billion US$ a year to set the incentives to reduce deforestation and forest degradation. The real costs may differ significantly from opportunity cost calculations though, both under an offset scheme and a market-linked approach, where prices would either be determined by the\r\nmarket or be negotiated. While prices will influence a countries decision to reduce deforestation, a price below the opportunity costs would not necessarily reverse a countries decision (and policies) to reduce deforestation. The discussion on how these funds should be raised continues to be the most controversial one. While the demand from the Annex-I compliance market in the 2013–2020 period could most likely absorb all emission reductions through a REDD offset mechanism, this would seriously undermine domestic emission reductions in countries listed in Annex-I of the UNFCCC (Annex-I countries) and set the world on a path towards dangerous climate change. Depending on whether Annex-I countries commit to low or ambitious 2020- targets in Copenhagen and the amount of emission reductions from REDD and the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM), Annex-I countries could offset 24 to 69 % of their emissions via the CDM and REDD (not counting Brazil). Furthermore, the present uncertainty on Annex-I reduction targets and quantitative “REDD targets” set by countries\r\nnot listed in Annex-I of the UNFCCC (non-Annex-I countries) makes it impossible to foresee the impact of REDD on carbon prices. Two models with different policy\r\nassumptions show, though, that REDD has a great potential to destabilize the compliance market, unless regulatory instruments, like e. g. banking of credits, are applied. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s (IPCC) 4th Assessment Report, emission reductions of 25–40 % in Annex-I and 15–30 % in non-Annex-I countries are necessary to see global emissions peak before 2015 and to stabilize the level of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere at 450 ppm, which is considered the threshold to\r\ndangerous climate change. To design REDD as an offset mechanism for Annex-I\r\ncompliance, Annex-I 2020-targets would need to be around 38 %. Limiting the amount of REDD offsets to be used for Annex-I compliance could solve the problem of domestic emission reductions. However, it would also reduce the amount of funding below the level deemed necessary to reduce deforestation significantly. Furthermore, there are legitimate concerns that an offset mechanism could potentially yield lower benefits for biodiversity\r\nconservation and lead to an inequitable distribution of funds, though this depends strongly on the governance structure and type of national transfer system of each participating country. Market-linked approaches such as the TDERM or another multilateral fund supplied with proceeds from the auctioning of emission allowances would also be able to raise the necessary funding without jeopardizing domestic emission reductions in Annex-I\r\ncountries. Here, estimates range from 5.7 to 113 bn US$ annually, though the top-end figure would have to be split between finance for adaptation, REDD and technology transfer.","citation":"Lars Holger Schmidt (2009)","page":1}

Convention on Biological Diversity stipulates the principle of incremental cost for the international financing of biodiversity conservation. The international debate about the exact meaning of the concept and about its practical application focuses on the issues of baseline determination and treatment of incremental domestic benefits. This paper uses some standard tools of partial equilibrium demand analysis to illustrate theoretical solutions to the indeterminacy of the Convention. The allocation of resources resulting from an incremental cost scheme is compared with a 'domestic optimum', and with a hypothetical 'global optimum'. Regarding the behaviour of the country hosting biodiversity, a distinction is proposed between 'quantity-' and 'transfer-' taking behaviour. The issue of price distortions in the baseline is also addressed. It is shown that both the host country (H) and the Rest of the World (ROW) will have incentives for agreeing on a transfer of resources that entails only partial deduction of domestic incremental benefits. This transfer, despite failing to reach the utilitarian global optimum, still represents a Pareto improvement over the pre-convention status quo. By imposing a particular multiplicative functional form on the utility of both host and ROW, additional results can be obtained. In particular, the optimal transfer implies a clawback factor decreasing with relative income differentials, and incremental cost financing dominates the domestic optimum even when price distortions are present in the host country. If removal of price distortions is a precondition for incremental cost funding, the analysis illustrates the magnitude of incentives necessary for the host to give up the distorted baseline.","citation":"Raffaello Cervigni (1998)","page":1}

The International Finance Corporation (IFC) Safeguard Policies have been the basis for IFC's leadership and approach to environmental and social sustainability. Based largely on the World Bank's operational policies, IFC adopted its current set of Safeguard Policies in 1998 in order to manage environmental and social issues in the private sector business environment in emerging markets. IFC embarked on an ambitious two-year process in FY04 to update all of the Safeguard Policies through a single initiative to develop the next generation of a policy framework based on a clear, concise and comprehensive policy on social and environmental sustainability. Following an intensive review and analysis of the strengths, weaknesses, and gaps in coverage of the current Safeguard Policies, IFC has recast the Safeguards as a Policy and Performance Standards on Social and Environmental Sustainability. The Performance Standards are often considered the defacto standards even in the absence of IFC participation in the project. They could potentially apply to all projects in developing countries. The Performance Standards contain clear and concise requirements geared toward project outcomes and promote performance improvement through monitoring, reporting and feedback. They place new emphasis on implementation through management systems, deal with social and environmental issues in a more integrated manner, and strengthen policy coverage of issues such as pollution, climate change, and biodiversity. In addition, the Performance Standards address a number of additional subjects of direct concern to the private sector such as labor and working conditions and community health and safety. IFC's social and environmental standards are the building blocks for our approach to sustainability and are embodied in IFC's Safeguard policies, Environmental Health and Safety Guidelines, and Disclosure Policy. Together these provide a framework to help our clients manage project risks and improve their performance, and help IFC improve development outcomes and maximize the development impact of our investments.","citation":"Patrick J.

to current notions about water abundance in Lebanon, the country is facing serious problems of unavailability, both in quantity and quality, geographical and sectoral. Even though this is due to several existing human-related aspects, i.e. management, ill-finance, non-integration and lack of relevant awareness on water use, the new dimension of climate change is unfortunately adding to the water problems in the country. Databases in Lebanon are not quite consistent and accurate, implying difficulty in interpreting correctly trends of change. Water supplies vary in the country from typically mild wet Mediterranean at the coast (600-800m.m.), through oromediterranean at the mountains (800-1200m.m.), to semi-arid inland (200 + 400m.m.). But actual records on the supply, i.e. precipitation, reflect a decreasing pattern over the last century. This is in agreement with predicted trends of temperature and precipitation values obtained from the GCM models over Lebanon. The HadCM2/HHGGax model predicts an average of 1.6 deg.C increase in temperature by the year 2020, and an equivalent average of about 3 percent less precipitation. Water balance is overall still positive, but deficits are commonly felt locally. The projection in ten to fifteen years, however, predicts an annual deficit of up to 800m.c.m. with the business as usual. The expected resultant impacts of climate change on resources, natural settings and human settings are directly related to water. The former includes, in addition to water itself, forestry, biodiversity and fisheries. In the latter two are incorporated inland and coastal zones as well as all the productive sectors. Cross impact structural analysis can reveal which socio-economic variables are most influenced, and then a driving power/dependency chart can reveal four types of strong or weak drivers, or otherwise. In view of the above, adaptation measures are given at strategic, population and individual levels with different opportunities from short to medium to long-term phases.","citation":"Mohamad Khawlie (2001)","page":1}

development of conservation technologies in plant genetic resources (PGR) is the backbone for agricultural development, food security and sustainable livelihood, now and for the future. In this paper, strategies for conservation of legumes pertaining to the collection, characterization, evaluation and conservation are presented. An integrated approach to legume PGR management in germplasm collection, characterization and evaluation, together with genetic conservation strategies both in situ and ex situ, for effective utilization is stressed. Emerging approaches such as diversity block, community biodiversity register and biodiversity fairs for genetic advancement of legumes are discussed. Collaborative efforts of farmers, scientists and policy makers in networking, capacity building, information sharing on legume PGR, and policy formulation on seed laws, quality, financing, and private-public sector partnership in legume seed development would enhance the sustainable utilization of legume genetic resources for food and agriculture.Le développement stratégique de technologies de conservation en resources génétiques de la plante (RGP) est l'épine dorsale pour le développement agricole, la sécurité alimentaire et le moyen d'existence durable, actuellement et pour l'avenir. Dans cet article, les stratégies pour la conservation de légumineuses se rapportant à la collection, la caractérisation, l'évaluation et la conservation sont présentées. Une approche intégrée à la gestion de RGP légumineuse en la collection, la caractérisation et l'évaluation de germeplasme considérée conjointement avec les stratégies de conservation génétique in situ et ex situ pour l'utilisation efficace est soulignée. Les approches émergeantes telles que le bloc de diversité, le registre de la biodiversité communautaire et les foires de biodiversité pour le progrès génétique de légumineuse sont discutés. Les efforts fait en collaboration avec les agriculteurs, les scientifiques, les décideurs, pour le travail en réseau, le renforcement de capacité, le partage d'information sur RGP légumineuse, ainsi que l'élaboration de principes sur les législations de graine, la qualité, le financement, l'association entre le secteur privé-public dans le développement de graine légumineuse, amélioréraient l'utilisation durable de resources génétiques de légumineuse pour l'alimentation et l'agriculture.

of life and living systems are a necessary condition for human development. As human use of resources, energy, and space intensified over the past few centuries, the diversity of life has been substantially diminished in most parts of the world. Conserving and restoring important components of the earth's biodiversity is our obligation to future generations. Biodiversity conservation is currently a principal goal for resource management of 11.5% of the world's surface area. However, substantial portions of non-human life occur outside of legally protected spaces. Even those that occur within reserves either move or have remnant populations outside. Maintaining connectivity between habitats, populations, and gene pools in and outside parks and reserves is vital for successful biodiversity conservation and restoration. Ecologists have proposed biological corridors, biosphere reserves, ecosystem management, and ecoregional planning as approaches to integrate biodiversity conservation and socioeconomic development at increasingly larger spatial scales. Ecosystem, species, and genetic level integrators appropriate to specific ecological, economic, political, social, and cultural contexts need to be identified, described, and tested in development planning and management. Globally, ecosystem services have gained attention as an integrator of biodiversity use and conservation that is amenable to economic valuation and could provide a basis for negotiations between conservation and development stakeholders. However, as the results of the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment showed, human societies tend to favor ecosystem services with a production bias, to the detriment of all others; three of the four services that have improved during the past 50 years are crop, livestock, and aquaculture production. The fourth service, enhanced carbon sequestration, has kindled hopes for linking emerging incentives in carbon markets and financing to biodiversity conservation and recovery. Critics claim that forest recovery leading to increased carbon sequestration has been confined to rich nations, and was possible only because the forests were previously exploited for production purposes. Climate change constraints and carbon-financing opportunities have emerged only in the past two or three decades. Voluntary initiatives in the financial sector to link land use, land-use change, and forestry with carbon sequestration and conservation, and recovery of biodiversity, must be seen as opportunities for using the best available ecological and other expert knowledge to improve the chances for biodiversity futures. Ecosystem services may also provide indirect ways to sustain species and genetic-level linkages between biodiversity in and around protected areas. Globally, humans are moving to the cities. The ethical and aesthetic implications of these human migrations are uncertain and open to debate. But abandoned lands in and around protected areas may be managed as wildlife habitats mixed with productive activities such as forestry, animal husbandry, and agriculture. Case studies and context-specific evidence of successful integration of biodiversity conservation at various levels and socioeconomic development at a range of spatial scales are urgently needed. Wide-ranging charismatic species almost always have spatial requirements that extend beyond parks and sanctuaries. They provide incentives and opportunities for planning and managing biodiversity at regional scales. In Sichuan, southwest China, forestry activities have been abandoned and provincial level plans to conserve and restore giant panda habitats are gaining acceptance among development planners. In 2002, following the Johannesburg Summit on Sustainable Development, UNEP and UNESCO launched the Great Apes Survival Project as a response to global concerns over the future of bonobos, chimpanzees, gorillas, and orangutans. The range of bonobos, for example, is restricted to selected parts of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, including forests lying outside legally protected areas. These initiatives will tell us whether it is possible to successfully integrate conservation and development practices. The other three great ape species, as well as many other species with large parts of their range outside protected areas, provide similar challenges and opportunities. Revival of commitments to conserve iconic species and populations, possibilities for influencing land-use change and forestry by linking ecosystem services and carbon financing, and compatibility between tourism and other productive sectors are opening up an era of options for integrating use and conservation of biodiversity. If these opportunities are to benefit both biodiversity and human society, ecologists must find new and constructive ways of working with development planners and decision makers. The Man and the Biosphere and other UNESCO programs for international cooperation are global platforms for trying out new ways of bringing conservation and development together.

on a global level livestock management is a multifunctional activity. Beyond their direct role in generating food and inc ome, livestock can be a valuable asset, serving as a store of wealth, collateral for credit and an essential safety net during times of crisis. Livestock are also central to mixed farming systems . Demand for livestock products in the future could b e heavily moderated by socio- economic factors such as human health concerns and changing socio-cultural values. There is considerable uncertainty as to how these factors wi ll play out in different regions of the world in the coming decades. The paper is divided into 4 sec tions. The first part makes a short presentation of the effect of livestock production on food secur ity at a global level through the analysis of official statistic data on the evolution of livesto ck production up to the present as well as an incursion into world data regarding events forecast by experts from FAO, OECD and other known research institutes for alimentary security at a gl obal level up to 2050 and 2100. The second part presents a dynamic analysis of data on a world leve l regarding the agro-livestock production and correlations with socio-economic factors as well as environmental factors at a global scale. Based on of specific literature presented on the en d of paper, and especially of own studies and researches of authors working group made inside the first Post-doctoral School financed by European Union for project with topics:  The Post doctoral School of livestock Biodiversity and Food Biotechnology based on Eco-economy and Bio-economy for Ecosanogenesis . Are presented more new concepts, terms, and methodological schemes about sustainable development of rural farms.

The annual review portion of the publication is divided into four sections: an overview, a series of regional review, a set of reviews on a spectrum of environmental and social issues, and a brief scan of relevant publications. The environmental and social issues discussed include: biodiversity conservation; fostering global warming solutions through energy efficiency, demand side management and renewable technologies; linking physical environmental effects to economic impacts; legal aspects of environmental management; building strategic alliance to avoid duplicating efforts in environmental work; Bank ' s work on pollution management and technology policy; engaging private sector into environmental investments; enhancing participatory approaches in decisionmaking; and freshwater, coastal and marine resource management. In addition, a new column called Reflection sets the context for the Bank ' s work in the larger global agenda drawn up in Rio ' s Agenda 21 in 1992.

the specter of a new farm bill on the horizon, considerable discussion is occurring concerning the possible redirection of conservation programming and financing. Notably, interest in the increased use of incentive systems and market-like instruments continues to expand. One source of this interest lies in the desire to shift some of the burden of providing ecosystem services, such as protecting stream and river channels from erosion, maintaining biodiversity, and providing clean water and air, to private sector pockets. For example, in the fall of 2006, USDA and EPA announced a joint partnership to support expanded water quality credit trading for nutrients in the Chesapeake Bay watershed, allowing farmers to receive compensation for water quality improvements. Carbon markets, such as the active program in the European Union, are also being discussed as a possible model for expanded market-like programs in agricultural conservation policy.

climate cooperation between industrial and developing countries was first proposed in the early l990s, then under the name of joint implementation (JI). Once in place, this cooperation could lead to a high amount of additional financial flows to developing countries. Nevertheless, many NGOs and developing country representatives were in the beginning very sceptical about JI and feared it would not take into account development priorities and create new kinds of dependence on industrial countries. Therefore, developing countries and industrial countries found a compromise at the Berlin Conference of the Parties as they instituted a pilot phase for so-called activities implemented jointly (AIJ), lasting until 2000. Since the Kyoto conference, this concept has existed in the design of the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM), which allows for industrialised countries to account this kind of activity against their national obligation for greenhouse gas reduction, starting with the year 2000. This paper discusses the first results of the Au pilot phase in Costa Rica, which is important for the evaluation of the whole pilot phase and the ultimate design of the CDM. Costa Rica has a relatively high level of economic and social development and a well-developed environmental policy, which is comparable with that of advanced industrial countries. It is a major destination for ecotourism. Nevertheless, it suffers from high deforestation, owing to unequal distribution of land, migration and cattle ranching, as well as plantation expansion. Moreover, transport emissions are rising rapidly and fossil fuel electricity generation is growing, despite a target of phasing out fossil fuels completely. Building on a broad knowledge base, Costa Rica was able to develop creative environmental policy instruments, such as debt-for-nature swaps and biodiversity prospecting, to attract foreign funding. It is not surprising that it was the first developing country to open an JI office, develop project approval criteria and host AIJ pilot projects. The framework for climate cooperation in Costa Rica can therefore be described as ideal compared with the average developing country. After an initial phase of single bilateral projects, the Costa Rican JI office tried to attract more finance by offering certified tradeable carbon certificates resulting form these projects' offsets. Now it encourages multi-sector large-scale programmes, where transaction costs are lower and coherence with national development objectives can be more easily checked. It directs its attention to public Au investors, such as the Norwegian government. The renewable energy projects suffer from the unrealistic target to phase out fossil fuels by 2001, thus making AIJ projects in this sector impossible from that time. Therefore, the bulk of projects concern forestry, which is prone to uncertainties in the calculation of emission sequestration. A comparison of the estimates shows wildly differing assumptions in baselines and the sequestration capacity of the forests. Whether actual project implementation conforms to the plans remains to be seen. The analysis of the Costa Rican case shows that climate cooperation can be successful in the long run only if the industrial countries offer incentives for investors and if baseline determination rests on a clear set of guidelines. Human and technical capacities are necessary but not sufficient conditions for successful climate cooperation projects in developing countries. They seem to be able to prevent complete project failures, however, and can lead to innovative approaches. The issue will be settled only if large-scale investment is forthcoming under a regime of legally binding emission targets for industrial countries, as stipulated in the Kyoto Protocol. Then the ability to process a huge number of project proposals and to check whether they conform to development priorities, as well as monitoring and verification, becomes crucial.","citation":"Michael Dutschke & Axel Michaelowa (2000)","page":1}

for environmental services (PES) is a promising mechanism for conservation. It also has the potential to contribute to social objectives such as poverty reduction. To promote synergy in the implementation of PES, however, a number of conditions on spatial, economic, ecological, and institutional feasibilities are essential. This study discusses factors affecting the synergy prospect of PES and provides a simple framework for assessing the potential for synergy in the implementation of PES, focusing on spatial correlation of thematic areas and funding availability for payments. We apply the framework to an empirical analysis of the “water funding” in Costa Rica, a new conservation financing source generated by water tariff revenue and will be channeled through the existing national PES program of Costa Rica (Pago por Servicios Ambientales, PSA). The analysis can help guide the re-allocation of the regular PSA budget in response to the water funding for synergy among conservation goals (watershed and biodiversity) and social development objective.","citation":"Wei Zhang & Stefano Pagiola (2009)","page":1}

conservation efforts are often related to benefits at higher governmental levels. On the one hand, these efforts are strongly connected to local land-use decisions. On the other hand, activities such as sustainable water management or biodiversity conservation are associated with regional, national or even global public goods. Therefore spatial externalities or spillovers exist that if not adequately compensated lead to an underprovision of the public goods and services concerned. This article investigates intergovernmental fiscal transfers as an innovative instrument to compensate local jurisdictions for the ecological goods and services they provide across local boundaries. From a public finance perspective, fiscal transfers are a suitable instrument to internalise spatial externalities. However, most federal states pre-dominantly use this feature for social and economic public functions rather than ecological public functions. This article investigates the case of the ICMS-E that has first been intro-duced by a few states in Brazil during the 1990s. Part of the revenue of this value-added tax is redistributed to the local level based on ecological indicators. In this way, the state level uses fiscal transfers to compensate municipalities for the existence of protected areas and other ecological services provided within their territory. The Brazilian experience illustrates that such fiscal transfers can represent both a compensation for land-use restrictions to be born and an incentive to appreciate and engage in more conservation activities at the local level.","citation":"Irene Ring (2004)","page":1}

second pillar of the CAP is expected to play a key role for rural development – especially for less favoured areas. Conservation of biodiversity and the cultural landscape and the competitiveness of farmers are important objectives addressed by different measures. The importance of the second pillar has been heavily emphasised for all the different objectives. The aim of the present paper is to analyse the programs of the second pillar for the federal state of Hesse, Germany. To give an overview of the programs the design of the measures is illustrated in detail. The programs are assessed from a theoretical point of view. Furthermore, the programs are classified into three axes in regard to the main objectives. The findings are threefold. Firstly, the Hessian rural development plan is very diverse in terms of program design, objectives and co-financing. Secondly, the assessment of second pillar programs lacks a detailed analysis considering effects and costs and comparing alternative measures. Thirdly, in Hesse the largest emphasis by financial means is applied to environmental and land management issues, namely the agri-environmental program.","citation":"Rüdiger Elsholz (2008)","page":1}

of Andean countries (Peru, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, and Venezuela) have encouraged migration to the Amazon Basin, which has contributed to its destruction. Population pressure, landlessness, and poverty are the inducements to migrate. Efforts to populate the Amazon forest were begun as early as 1964 in Peru without international notice. By 1980, logging was allowed in Peru, and Brazil considered colonization of the Amazon essential to national sovereignty. By 1986, outside of Lima, Peru, a development project originally funded by the World Bank, the InterAmerican Development Bank, and the US, resulted in conflicts between settlers and Indians, in loggers indiscriminately cutting, and in farmers using slash and burn techniques to clear forests. Elsewhere the Peruvian Amazon, in San Ignacio, the population was growing by 5.5%/year. The jungle road that had been started but never completed, Carretera Marginal, destroyed 5 million hectares of primary forest, and much of the 600,000 hectares of arable land gained by the road suffered from inappropriate farming practices which caused massive erosion and laterization of the soils. Food crop production declined, and production of coca for cocaine increased. Coca crops are controlled by the Shining Path guerrillas, who are trying to overthrow the Peruvian government. Devastation of Ecuador around Lago Agrio continues. In Colombia, east of Bogota, forests have disappeared and hills have eroded and silted up rivers and dams. The Andean piedmont in Bolivia has also been devastated by loggers and by slash and burn farming. Southeastern Bolivian forests have been cleared for soya bean cultivation on poor soils. Social and economic crises propel people into the remaining forests. The solution is to ease foreign debt, transfer appropriate technology at affordable prices, refuse to finance destructive development, and help to educate and train scientific researchers. Family planning services are also urgently needed. Basic facts on population, biodiversity, the greenhouse effect, deforestation, roads, iron, gold, and Indians is provided.","citation":"J Serra-vega (1990)","page":1}

Topics include the increased role of local communities and NGOs in bringing environmental problems to the attention of governments; the need of governments for clear and specific legislative commitments to environmental protection in mining and petroleum legislation and a clear legislative and administrative mandate that will lead to the selection mining an petroleum companies that have well‐established environmental protection track records and the capability to finance environmental protection. In addition, this section discusses the need for legislation and contracts to establish fiscal regimes that encourage environmentally sound mining and drilling practices as well as the need for NGOs and international organizations to play a stronger role in facilitating the sharing of experience among countries with regard to environmental and biodiversity protection.","citation":"Frederick T.

‘consumer society’ has become a ‘consumer oligopoly’ in Britain as the big four supermarkets, Tesco, Asda, Sainsbury, and Morrison have between them captured a 75% share of the grocery market. This has been achieved through globalisation, the attainment of large economies of scale, and major deployment of buying power. Total annual profits of the ‘big four’ UK supermarkets now stand at £3 billion, and several millions of this is spent on charitable causes and other CSR activities such as promoting sustainable development. However the spectacular growth of the supermarkets over the past fifty years has not been to the benefit of all. Some consumers have seen their access to healthy food curtailed as local shops have closed, and the quality of their diet has fallen; this is often referred to as the ‘food deserts’ phenomenon. The spatial scale of ‘food deserts’, the coping strategies employed by those affected by such ‘deserts’, and the solutions proposed to alleviate food access problems, are profoundly local in character, typically operating over distances of less than two kilometres. This paper suggests that a re‐focussing of the CSR activities of supermarkets towards the local scale can not only boost the social image of the supermarkets in fields where their impact is seen as negative, but can also be profitable for these corporations. Further benefits of a more local perspective include environmental advantages such as the maintenance of biodiversity and support for farmers whose incomes may be in decline. In tandem with a global commercial outlook, supermarkets have engaged with government at a national level to further their business interests. Simultaneously, governmental power within Britain has also moved from the local to the national level. In contrast, many organisations representing disadvantaged groups call for a localised, ‘bottom‐up’, approach. Britain's current centralised ‘top‐down’ approach to governance may be driven by financial pressures or ideological considerations, but this has nevertheless alienated some voters from government. This shift has prompted a certain disengagement with political processes for some individuals, and a shift towards ‘direct action’ tactics which may be damaging to commercial activities. It is argued here that a realignment of the supermarket's engagement with politics from the national to the local level is possible, financed by the resources the supermarkets currently devote to CSR activities. This re‐localisation of supermarket political activity would in fact pay dividends for the ‘big four’ retailers, because by helping to re‐build the legitimacy of national government it would create a more stable environment for business within the UK.","citation":"Hillary J.

Notes An earlier version of this article appeared as a background paper for the World Bank's World Development Report 2003. Additional material draws on case studies produced under the author's direction at the RARE Center for Tropical Conservation, with research assistance from Cristin Tighe and Mary Ann Kutny. The author wishes to thank Russell Dalton for timely access to data from the GEOS survey. 2For the most comprehensive cross-national survey, see R.E. Dunlap, G.H. Gallup & A.M. Gallup, Health of the Planet: Results of a 1992 International Environmental Opinion Survey of Citizens in 24 Nations, (1993). Analyses of these and other public opinion data are provided in R.E. Dunlap & A.G. Mertig, Global Concern for the Environment: Is Affluence a Prerequisite?, 51(4) J. Social Issues 121-137 (1995); S.R. Brechin & W. Kempton, Global Environmentalism: A Challenge to the Postmaterialism Thesis?, 75(2) Social Sci. Q. 245-269 (1994); Q. Kidd & A.-R. Lee Postmaterial Values and the Environment: A Critique and Reappraisal, 78(1) Social Sci. Q. 1-15 (1997). 3A political analysis of the impressive accomplishments of Costa Rica and Bolivia in the realm of biodiversity policy is provided in P.F. Steinberg, Environmental Leadership in Developing Countries: Transnational Relations and Biodiversity Policy in Costa Rica & Bolivia. (2001). 4The poor record of protected areas management in the tropics is reviewed in C. van Schaik, J. Terborgh, and B. Dugelby, The Silent Crisis: The State of Rain Forest Nature Preserves, in Last Stand—Protected Areas and the Defense of Tropical Biodiversity 64-89 (R. Kramer, C. van Schaik, & J. Johnson, eds. 1997). Although some researchers of the political ecology school (see for example S.R. Brechin et al. (eds.), Contested Nature: Promoting International Biodiversity with Social Justice in the Twenty-first Century (2003)) take issue with van Schaik and colleagues about the underlying causes of these problems—placing greater emphasis on social justice rather than improved enforcement—the two sides agree that current strategies are far from adequate. The rampant trade in illegally harvested tropical timber is described in Environmental Investigation Agency & Telapak, Profiting from Plunder: How Malaysia Smuggles Endangered Wood (2004). The challenge of implementing pollution reduction strategies in developing countries has been the subject of extensive research by the World Bank's New Ideas in Pollution Regulation Program. See for example World Bank, Greening Industry—New Roles for Communities, Markets, and Governments, A World Bank Policy Research Report. (2000) 5 See for example R.O. Keohane, Analyzing the Effectiveness of International Environmental Institutions, in Institutions for Environmental Aid: Pitfalls and Promise 3-27 (R.O. Keohane & M.A. Levy, eds. 1996). 6The synergistic concept of civic conservation presented here is consistent with usage of the term civic environmentalism in C.Sirianni & L. Friedland, Civic Innovation in America: Community Empowerment, Public Policy, and the Movement for Civic Renewal (2001). It is important to distinguish the present usage from that of DeWitt, who describes civil society alternatives to government regulation. See J. DeWitt, Civic Environmentalism: Alternatives to Regulation in States and Communities. (1994). 7P. Wapner, Environmental Activism and Civic World Politics. (1996); T. Princen & M. Finger, Environmental NGOs in world politics: Linking the local and the global. (1994). 8 See for example M. Edwards & D. Hulme (eds.), Beyond the Magic Bullet: NGO Performance & Accountability in the Post-Cold War World. (1996). 9There is a considerable but seldom acknowledged congruence between the thinking of populists and libertarians on this point. Compare for example J.C. Scott, Seeing like a State: How Certain Schemes to Improve the Human Condition Have Failed (1998); M. Friedman, Capitalism & Freedom (1962). 10 See P. Hirsch (ed.), Seeing the Forest for the Trees: Environment and Environmentalism in Thailand (1996). See also S.M. Darlington, Rethinking Buddhism and Development: The Emergence of Environmentalist Monks in Thailand, 7 J. Buddhist Ethics (online journal) (2000). 11 All Things Considered: Feature on Artists Protesting Pollution in Tehran (National Public Radio, March 5, 2000). 12 See M.J. Esman & N. Uphoff, Local Organizations: Intermediaries in Rural Development. (1984); J. Fisher, The Road from Rio: Sustainable Development and the Nongovernmental Movement in the Third World. (1993); J.

is considered as one of world’s highest priority in biodiversity conservation. This is linked not only with the high degree of diversity and endemism but also the ongoing threats of the natural communities. However, efforts have been underway at different levels in Madagascar with the new vision Madagascar Naturally and the proposed five year plan Madagascar Action Plan (MAP), to protect and valorise the unique and rich biological diversity, in collaboration with all stakeholders, including the International communities. The new Protected Areas System of Madagascar represent an important benchmark in an overall plan for conservation and sustainable development, first unveiled by Excellency President Marc Ravalomanana at the World Parks Congress in Durban, South Africa in 2003. The President committed to increase the total size of protected areas to 10 % of the country’s territory, from 1.7 million hectares to 6 million hectares, in a five-year period to ensure the conservation of these unique biodiversity. One of the key aims of the new Protected Areas System of Madagascar is to strengthen the integration of Conservation and Development for sustainable management of resources. In addition, the involvement and empowerment of stakeholders, including local communities, traditional leaders, private sectors, government or non government organizations, play an important role in this new system of protected areas. The Ministry of Environment, Water and Forests, has targeted about one million hectares of protected areas to be classified each year, to reach this objective of six millions hectares over five years. The first one million hectares of this system of protected areas has been classified in 2005, and the classification of the next one million hectares for 2006 is going to the right direction. In addition to the declaration of the President of Madagascar in Durban, recently during the General Assembly of the United Nations in New York in September 2005, the President of Madagascar has also announced to allocate 8 % of the cancelled external debt of Madagascar, to support biodiversity conservation and environmental management, for sustainable financing of all efforts in Madagascar Conserving the natural communities is critical not only to biodiversity, but also to the people who rely on the resources for their livelihoods. Conservation does not mean full protection, and exclude human being. We all need to understand that conservation includes sustainable management, protection and preservation. The importance of zoning would play an important role in this undertaking. One would need to consider a zoned area that could be harvested with control, another one for ecotourism, another zone for protection and so on. To live in a safe and healthy environment does not only mean protecting species in their natural habitat, but also enhancing the life quality of each citizen. Therefore it is very important that we all work together to achieve this goal and that conservation efforts go hand in hand with development. I welcome this new journal MADAGASCAR CONSERVATION & DEVELOPMENT as it deals largely and exclusively with Conservation and/or Development in Madagascar. Biodiversity Conservation would not go alone without Development and vice versa. I encourage Malagasy researchers, students, decision makers to contribute to this journal as this new journal aims to provide a forum for exchange of information and experiences, about all aspects of conservation and development work in Madagascar. It will also play an important role as an early warning for interested people to threats to nature and culture as they arise. Therefore, this new journal arrives at the right time, as it will provide a kit for both, conservation and development practitioners in Madagascar.

are four conservation areas around Subotica in northern Backa covering 7 606 ha with mosaicaly spread habitats and high biodiversity. The managing problems are numerous not only due to ecological problems of fragmentation, lack of ecocoridorrs and low populations of natural rarities. There are numerous problems in protection and management as a result of many unsettled questions by the legislation and state institutions, no coordination between different resorts concerning land use in conservation areas (urbanism, building authorities, water management, agriculture, forestry, environment protection), no nature protection strategy backed up by a system and no continuous financing for development of nature protection activities.

wide-ranging contents of this special issue on of water have stimulated a number of thoughts on my part as a former practitioner in this area. My views are grouped below around seven topics: concept of water itself; levels at which can be handled; Integrated Water Resource Management (IWRM) as a leading paradigm of governance; water rights; accountability and voice; transparency and corruption; and options of financing at national and scales. I conclude by anticipating some themes from forthcoming third edition of World Water Development Report (WWDR-3). (1) Sound management of water is a function of a complex interaction of numerous factors, including demographics, economic development and trade, social and cultural processes, consumption patterns, technology, and climate. Moreover, many of these factors are changing rapidly, adding further complexity. This situation rules out any possibility for universal templates or one-size-fits-all solutions to water management. That said, when properly planned and implemented, instruments can affect water's drivers and uses to improve efficiency, equity, and sustainability. Unfortunately, however, most important decisions impacting water today are often being made in domains outside that of water, without water being considered as a priority topic. For example, decisions about health, food, and energy on a sector basis or about poverty reduction and sustainable development in broader frameworks can have a major impact on water resources. The Concept of Governance: Is Elastic Stretched Too Far? In area of water more specifically, has been defined as the range of political, social, economic and administrative systems that are in place to develop and manage water resources, and delivery of water services, at different levels of society. (2) In this vein, Global Water Partnership (GWP) ToolBox on Integrated Water Resource Management contains almost fifty components. More concisely, Claudia Pahl-Wostl, Joyeeta Gupta, and Daniel Petry have described in this special issue as how water resources can be managed best. Global adds an extra layer to a matrix that is already quite complex. Is there a risk that governance is becoming such a broad concept, covering anything that isn't pipes and pumps, that it may lose its resonance? Should we first unpack still rather inchoate concept of at other levels before promoting it in arena? In any case, it is important to distinguish aspects of that are truly global from those that are actually international or merely widespread. Many water issues arise between specific countries in a trans-boundary or regional context. This makes water different from truly issues such as climate change or biodiversity issues, in which carbon emissions and species losses affect whole of humanity. We need to be clear which water issues are veritably global. Two issues of water clearly must be handled at a level. The first is process to make more rational system that allocates water management responsibilities among institutions (see Pahl-Wostl, Gupta, and Petry, this issue). Until recently, two dozen agencies and programs of United Nations claimed responsibility for various aspects of water. Now UN Water exists as a central coordinating body, providing an opportunity to acquire critical mass on water issues while preserving concerns of other agencies. A second aspect of water requiring attention is of trade through World Trade Organization (WTO). The concepts of virtual water and water footprints are starting to have traction for both national and policymakers. An article in this issue (see Liao, de Fraiture, and Giordano) demonstrates that expansion of China's exports following its entry into WTO may aggravate its already serious water constraints. …","citation":"Olcay Ünver (2008)","page":1}

Mainstreaming Market Based Instruments for Environmental Management Project will assist the Government of Costa Rica (and FONAFIFO - National Fund for Forestry Financing - in particular) in consolidating and expanding its instrument of Payment for Environmental Services (PES) thereby increasing the proportion of funding for PES activities generated from payments from service users; extending the scope of PES activities in new areas and improving the efficiency of current activities; and, improving the contribution of PES activities to poverty reduction. Specifically, the project seeks to regain degraded, grazing land to convert it into either forests, or to attain agro-forestry systems. The project region fits into what conservationists describe as Eco-region of Isthmian-Pacific Forests, with diverse wildlife zones: tropical rain forest, very humid tropical rainforest, basal forest, transitional tropical forest, and tropical pre-forest. The nature of the project will certainly benefit the environment; however, its implementation may foster some environmental adversity, namely, soil erosion, surface and groundwater contamination, and air pollution due to infrastructure works, as well as an endangered biodiversity, and land degradation due to misuse of pesticides. It is paramount the institutional framework be strengthened to appropriately inform farmers, and indigenous populations in the area on new agricultural extension technologies, followed by relevant capacity building. Within the project design, financing will be available to enhance agro-forestry systems, and, it is further recommended that FONAFIFO implement agricultural economy studies to form the basis for commercial activities, namely for coffee - and the potential for growing coffee around shadowy areas - and livestock, but also as important, those for other agricultural products in the area. Also recommended are an inventory on seedlings and certified seeds; enhanced cooperation on fire prevention and control; improved pastures for livestock development; integrated biodiversity conservation and sustainable development practices; introduction of new technologies for ecosystem rehabilitation; awareness and information on the use of aquifers, and hydroelectricity; and, training assistance and capacity building skills in the use of, and PES reinvestments.","citation":"Carlos Borge Carvajal & Ruth Tiffer Sotomayor (2005)","page":1}

environmental policy certainly could gain strength if the management of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) or of the UN Commission on Sustainable Development (CSD) were made more efficient. However, such a minimalist strategy of efficiency improvement is no panacea: it can only be an element, not the core of a new global environmental policy. Therefore, instead of merely calling for improved efficiency and coordination, in this paper a proposal is made to establish a World Environment and Development Organization (WEDO) as a new specialized agency of the United Nations. At the very least, such an Organization should integrate UNEP, the CSD and the relevant Convention Secretariats (climate, biodiversity, desertification conventions); close cooperation with the Bretton Woods institutions - the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the World Trade Organization (WTO) - and the existing UN specialized agencies would need to be ensured. Also, ideas are being presented on the decision-making procedures, the participation of Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs), and on the financing of such a World Environment and Development Organization.","citation":"Frank Biermann & Udo E.

D. SACHS is the Director of the Earth Institute, Quetelet Professor of Sustainable Development, and Professor of Health Policy and Management at Columbia University. He is also Director of the UN Millennium Project and Special Advisor to United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan on the Millennium Development (MDGs). Sachs is internationally renowned for his work as economic advisor to governments in Latin America, Eastern Europe, the former Soviet Union, Asia and Africa, and his work with international agencies on problems of reduction, debt cancellation for the poorest countries, and disease control. He is a Research Associate of the National Bureau of Economic Research. Sachs has been an advisor to the IMF, the World Bank, the OECD, the World Health Organization (WHO), and the United Nations Development Program, among other international agencies. During 2000-2001, he was Chairman of the Commission on Macroeconomics and Health of the WHO, and from September 1999 through March 2000 he served as a member of the International Financial Institutions Advisory Commission, established by the U.S. Congress. Dr. Sachs spoke with the Journalon March 10, 2005. JOURNAL: Your report Investing in Development: A Practical Plan to Achieve the Millennium Development Goals presents some very detailed prescriptions in its nearly 3,000 pages (with supporting volumes). Some of the recommendations suggest a fairly radical departure from the way things are currently done, yet you seem confident that such shifts in approach would put the MDGs within reach for 2015. If donor nations are not yet prepared to follow all of your recommendations, will the still be reachable? What would the impact on development progress be if your plan was followed in a limited way? What are the most important aspects of the plan that would need to be followed to achieve the greatest results? SACHS: Basically, we're advocating a change from business-as-usual that can be summarized as a big scaling-up of investments in three critical areas: 1) investment in people, which means investments in health, education, nutrition and family planning; 2) investment in the environment, mainly investment in soils, land, water and biodiversity conservation; and 3) investment in infrastructure--power, roads, motor transport, port facilities, communications. We think that if these scaled-up investments are made, this should enable the poorest countries to break out of the poverty trap, to begin self-sustaining economic growth within the decade and to achieve the MDGs in particular by 2015. These are not expensive interventions, in that the cost of doing this would be within the 0.7 percent of GNP that the rich countries have long promised the poor countries but haven't yet delivered. So these are affordable investments, but they are not free. It's realistic to say to the poor countries, do these things. They require help--much more help than is being offered right now. And so we are looking for a breakthrough in donor assistance this year. The March 2005 report by Prime Minister Tony Blair's Africa Commission calls for essentially the same approach for Africa as we do--more development aid, financing, a significant step-up of investments. I think we're going to see a number of countries on the donor side follow through on these recommendations--so far mainly in Europe, but I've just come back from Japan, where I see a renewed sense that development assistance needs to be raised, and I am hoping that the US, which is the biggest lagger of all the donor countries, will finally begin to get its act together as well. Of course the US's lack of adequate assistance is one of the biggest barriers to the success of the MDGs. This country definitely has its mind on other things, and that's quite regrettable in my mind, because I think American foreign policy is not properly attuned to the challenges of extreme I am still hoping that I could say even the US is going to come around and follow through on its own commitments to contribute much more to development assistance. …","citation":"Sara Regine Hassett & Christine Weydig (2005)","page":1}

training system should be improved,eco-environmental education of tourism employees should be strengthened,the whole environmental education on tourists should be carried out,environmental interpretation system should be established and the tourism should be developed and managed by the guidance of academic group;in order to build up the ecological environment monitoring and pre-warning system,the long-time located environmental monitoring system should be established,biodiversity conservation and ecosystem health management system should be set up,the natural disaster prevention system should be improved;in order to improve the legal protection system,the policies and regulations should be improved and supervision and law enforcement should be strengthen;in order to build a multi-channel financing system for eco-environmental protection management,the issuance of lottery and non-governmental capital financing methods could be carried out.","citation":"Cheng Feng-ming

The monitoring, as carried out by EROS staff and their Senegalese collaborators, has involved use of information collected by remote sensing (satellite and aerial photographs) as well as extensive field work including the collection of physical information about soils, vegetation, land use practices, and biodiversity at 2 over 600 sites in all parts of the country (Tappan and Wood, 1995). This information provides a remarkable record of changes in physical and land cover parameters over the last 30 years.

environment, climate change and the management of natural resources have been taking centre stage with policy-makers and governments in Southeast Asia. It is now recognized that environmental degradation cannot continue unabated over the long term. It is already affecting countries, their economies and communities. Economic and social well-being will depend on how well environmental resources are managed. Concern for the environment was well documented in the Third ASEAN State of the Environment Report 2006: Towards an Environmentally Sustainable Community (SOE 2006). (1) In this report, ASEAN leaders stressed that the resources used to fuel economic growth have to be utilized in a sustainable manner, in order to ensure that prosperity in the region will be durable. ASEAN leaders have also acknowledged that sustainable development, with a dynamic and mutually supportive balance between economic growth, social equity and environmental integrity are to be the guiding principle to establish the ASEAN Community. One way to achieve this balance would be by reconciling economic-environmental trade-offs within the social setting in public policy making. Due consideration must be paid to protecting the environment and its natural resources by ensuring that resources are used in a way that benefits society as a whole, not just private interests. To do this, we need an accurate assessment of the value of environmental goods and services to society. ASEAN faces enormous challenges. Besides ongoing efforts at economic integration and political cooperation, and the high poverty incidence in Cambodia, Lao PDR, Myanmar, the Philippines and Vietnam, (2) there is a need to redress environmental problems like air and noise pollution, sewage disposal and management, traffic congestion, land degradation and deforestation, the depletion of natural resources and biodiversity, damage to marine and coastal ecosystems, depletion of the ozone layer and excessive emissions of greenhouse gases. Managing environmental resources is not easy. Markets normally do a good job of dealing with scarcity--as things become scarcer, their prices increase, people consume less of them and producers invest more in producing them. However, this does not happen when environmental goods become scarce, because few of them are bought or sold in markets. Many are also subject to misguided government policies that encourage environmental destruction by, for example, subsidizing energy consumption, over-fishing and deforestation. Environmental economics can help us to recognize the economic cost and causes of environmental depletion and so help us to react quickly--by strengthening property rights (either private or community-based), applying corrective taxes and so on. Economics can also help us design environmental laws that incorporate workable economic incentives and that, therefore, have a good chance of affecting behaviour. Conversely, environmental economics can reveal the full environmental costs of human activity. By assessing such costs and incorporating them into the prices of goods, we can use market forces to bring about environmental protection: If we all had to pay the full environmental cost of our activities, we would soon learn to conserve resources and to consume in less damaging ways. The papers in this special issue deal in varying degrees the need to price environmental resources. They also address some of the issues identified in the SOE 2006. Specifically, they use economic analysis to examine issues surrounding climate change, environmental degradation and the depletion of natural resources. The authors have been given a free hand to approach these issues from a quantitative or qualitative perspective, and on any aspect of the environment, provided they focus on ASEAN as a region or on ASEAN member countries. These papers report the findings of a series of research projects financed by the Economy and Environment Program for Southeast Asia (EEPSEA). …","citation":"D.W.

for environmental services (PES) is a promising mechanism for conservation. It also has the potential to contribute to social objectives such as poverty reduction. To promote synergy in the implementation of PES, however, a number of conditions on spatial, economic, ecological, and institutional feasibilities are essential. This study discusses factors affecting the synergy prospect of PES and provides a simple framework for assessing the potential for synergy in the implementation of PES, focusing on spatial correlation of thematic areas and funding availability for payments. We apply the framework to an empirical analysis of the “water funding” in Costa Rica, a new conservation financing source generated by water tariff revenue and will be channeled through the existing national PES program of Costa Rica (Pago por Servicios Ambientales, PSA). The analysis can help guide the re-allocation of the regular PSA budget in response to the water funding for synergy among conservation goals (watershed and biodiversity) and social development objective.","citation":"Wei Zhang & Stefano Pagiola (2009)","page":1}

food situation in India is worsening day by day, mainly due to an ever increasing human population. It is difficult to increase crop productivity with the current availability of land, water resources, labour, finance and crop production technology. Among the newer technologies, the cultivation of genetically modified crops (GMCs) may help in improving food availability, nutritional quality and shelf life of harvested produce and in developing plants resistant to insect pests, disease pathogens and herbicides. However, GMCs have attracted many critics because of their potential impacts on biodiversity, toxicity to non-target organisms, cross-resistance in pests, the higher prices of seeds and foods, monopoly of companies, patent and regulatory approval, and safety to consumers. Some consider that GMCs are unwanted, unsafe and unnecessary, while others favour their introduction and use in India. The debate continues among scientists, policy makers, social activists, farmers and consumers, but this situation may change in the near future because of the impact of World Trade Organization (WTO) policies on globalization and the free market.","citation":"R.

widely debated mechanism avoided (REDD), would benefit developing countries that reduce their deforestation rates, thereby generating at least two positive impacts : (i) a greater effectiveness of the global climate change mitigation efforts, and (ii) expected positive side effects on, e.g., biodiversity conservation. Several proposals were designed for the mechanism, which implementation is challenging: firstly, sophisticated tools available to measure the reduction of emissions (e.g. remote sensing) might be ineffective when combined with national baselines; secondly, predictive baselines lack accuracy because of insufficient knowledge concerning the causes of deforestation, and the unpredictable evolution of key variables (e.g. agricultural commodity prices); thirdly, historical baselines lack legitimacy because they only refer to past trends; and fourthly, a reduction in deforestation rates is hardly connectable to specific public policies. Based on our analysis, we recommend not promoting any mechanism within the Kyoto Protocol based on financial rewards for assumed national emissions reductions from deforestation. Two reasons justify our perspective: not only would the mechanism probably generate fake reductions (hot air), but undesirable side effects would also appear. Instead, we encourage use of funds made available as carbon finance (broadly speaking) for reinforcing multi- and bilateral instruments that relate to forest management in developing countries, with a focus on the correction of governance deficiencies. In addition, we support any initiative that mitigates perverse incentives from public policies in tropical and industrialized countries.","citation":"Romain Pirard & Alain Karsenty (2009)","page":1}

Bay of Ranobe, in southwest Madagascar, once noted for its high biodiversity and fish abundance, is under increasing pressure from overfishing, pollution, sedimentation and tourism. The declining health of the coral reef is reflected in fishery productivity and survey data on biological diversity. Sustainable conservation requires the engagement of all interested parties and the integration of their needs into resource management. The British NGO ReefDoctor has adopted this approach in establishing the first community-protected site in the Bay of Ranobe, the Massif des Roses. This is a large coral patch with a high percentage of live coral cover (38 % ) and important fish diversity compared to other sites surveyed in the lagoon. Since 25 May 2007 it has been legally recognised as a community managed marine reserve under temporary protection where fishing is banned. Tourists must now pay an entry fee to visit the site, with the proceeds contributing to the funding of community projects. In conjunction with the protection of this site, ReefDoctor has worked with local people, regional and local government, tour operators and hotels, and conservation organisations to set up ‘FIMIHARA’, an association representative of local people responsible for the management of this site and the development of sustainable conservation initiatives in the Bay of Ranobe. This paper explains the approach taken by ReefDoctor, by setting up and working with FIMIHARA, to protect the Massif des Roses site and develop other conservation initiatives and community projects in the Bay of Ranobe. La baie de Ranobe, au sud - ouest de Madagascar, autrefois remarquable pour sa biodiversité et l’abondance de la pêche, est de plus en plus menacée par la surpêche, la sédimentation, la pollution et le tourisme. Le déclin de l’état de santé du récif corallien se reflète dans la diminution de la productivité des pêcheries et dans les suivis de la biodiversité marine. La situation est à présent critique car les ressources marines associées au récif assurent la subsistance des populations côtières vivant le long de la baie. Nous considérons ici qu’une protection pérenne nécessite un engagement concret de toutes les parties prenantes - en particulier des communautés locales - et que leurs besoins soient intégrés dans la gestion des ressources. L’ONG ReefDoctor a mis en oeuvre cette approche lors de la création de la première réserve marine dans la baie de Ranobe gérée par la communauté locale, le Massif des Roses. Cette réserve est constituée d’un grand massif de corail largement couvert de coraux et abritant une importante diversité de poissons par rapport au reste du lagon. Depuis le 25 mai 2007, ce site est légalement reconnu comme réserve marine communautaire avec un statut de protection temporaire ; la pêche et les pratiques destructrices associées au tourisme y sont interdites. De plus, les touristes doivent désormais payer un droit d’entrée pour visiter le site, qui contribue au financement de projets communautaires. En parallèle avec la protection du site, ReefDoctor a travaillé avec les communautés locales, les responsables nationaux et régionaux du gouvernement, les opérateurs touristiques et diverses organisations de protection de la nature pour créer l’association FIMIHARA, représentative de la population locale. Cette association, qui a un statut légal depuis le 11 avril 2007, a pour but d’améliorer la qualité de vie de ceux qui vivent le long de la baie de Ranobe et de mettre en oeuvre des projets de conservation des ressources marines et terrestres dans la région de la baie de Ranobe. La création de la réserve marine communautaire du Massif des Roses a rapidement connu le succès qui s’est traduit par la vente de plus d’un millier de tickets, mais l’association FIMIHARA doit encore faire face à de nombreux défis. L’objectif principal de l’association à long terme est de développer son indépendance par rapport à l’ONG ReefDoctor et sa capacité à gérer indépendamment les ressources marines de la baie de Ranobe dont les communautés locales dépendent pour leur survie.","citation":"RD Stein - Rostaing et al.

The project resulted in proposals for national and pilot agri-environment programmes. The project addressed key actors working on agri-environmental issues in Croatia, such as government representatives, scientists, farmers, environmental and nature conservation NGOs.\r\n\r\nAn AE Programme has been operating in the EU since 1992. Today it is the only obligatory measure under the EU Rural Development Regulation. The costs of the AE programmes are part-financed from the EU budget and partly from national budgets. The programme is based on voluntary agreements between farmers and public authorities and currently covers some 25% of agricultural land in the EU. The AE schemes have become an important policy instrument for protecting the environment and maintaining biodiversity on EU agricultural land. \r\n\r\nAt present Croatia still does not have the appropriate legislative framework needed to facilitate an AE programme. However, Croatia has been working to improve this situation: a Code of Good Agricultural Practices and a National Programme for Agriculture and Rural Areas are soon to be adopted. The Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Water Management runs a comprehensive agricultural support scheme for farmers. However, 98% of this budget is devoted to production-linked direct payments, while support for rural development is limited to only 0.4% of the total agricultural aid budget. Except for subsidies for organic farming and local breeds, currently there are no other financial provisions for environmentally friendly farming in Croatia. Responsibility for environmental and nature protection in Croatia is divided between three ministries: the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Water Management; the Ministry of Environmental Protection, Spatial Planning and Construction; and the Ministry of Culture (nature protection). There are a number of opportunities for the introduction of an agri-environment programme in Croatia, notably the political climate and Croatia's aspirations to join the EU. However, there are also some obstacles. A particular problem is the high level of the current direct payments. In order to be attractive enough, the AE subsidies would have to be high as well. \r\n\r\nThe Croatian agricultural sector has two parallel production systems: private family farms and agricultural companies. Private farming constitutes the core of the agricultural sector of Croatia. The recent agricultural census, satellite images and the Ministry of Agriculture's Farm Register indicate that the agricultural area utilised in Croatia is nearly three times smaller than the agricultural area recorded in official statistics. According to these figures, Croatia has only 0.18 ha of arable land per capita, which puts it in the group of countries with a critical land per capita ratio. This is also one of the reasons why Croatia is a great food importer and is self-sufficient in only five agricultural products. \r\n\r\nAgriculture is by far the biggest single influence on the Croatian environment and countryside. Croatia practices bipolar agriculture: high-input in regions with intensive arable farming and low-input farming in less favoured areas, most of which are karst regions. The environmental impact of Croatian agriculture is much greater than usually believed. Croatia is a heavy user of mineral fertilisers and pesticides. With an average consumption of 260 kg of nutrients and 4.1 kg of pesticide active ingredients per ha of arable land in the last five years, Croatia significantly exceeds the EU average. Agri-chemicals are applied only on arable land and permanent crops. Most Croatian farms practice very narrow crop rotation, resulting in a number of environmental problems and a decline in biodiversity. Soil erosion is a significant problem, although the biggest one seems to be land abandonment. Shrubs and forest-like vegetation are rapidly invading a vast area of Croatian agricultural land, notably species-rich grassland. \r\n\r\nThe Croatian AE programme is designed to contribute to environmental and nature protection and the countryside. It will encourage farmers to continue practising environmentally friendly measures or introduce those that are not economically attractive, but essential from the environmental and biodiversity point of view. In this respect, the Programme is an instrument through which Croatian society rewards farmers for the public goods and services they provide (clean water and air, fertile soil, rich biodiversity, appealing landscape, etc.). Through the AE payments, Croatian society would reward farmers for the public goods and services they provide, as the value of this is not recognised by the market.\r\n \r\nThe Agri-Environment Programme has been designed to respond to two major problems that Croatia faces concerning agriculture, and environmental and nature protection: a rapid decline in (grassland) biodiversity and environmental degradation caused by inappropriate agricultural practices. \r\n\r\nThe AE Programme consists of six schemes: \r\n1. The Information Transfer Scheme \r\nIt should provide training to farmers, administrators and extensionists, as well as inform general public on the Programme importance.\r\n2. Abandoned Land Clearance Scheme \r\nThis Scheme should enable farmers to clean and restore agricultural land overgrown by shrubs.\r\n3. Arable Land Scheme\r\nIt facilitates reduction of environmental pressure caused by intensive arable farming. The Scheme consists of the following packages: crop rotation, undersowing, anti-erosion and field strips package. \r\n4. Organic Farming Scheme\r\nThis should protect soil, water, air and biodiversity by increasing the area under organic management.\r\n5. Grassland Scheme\r\nIt encourages farmers to continue with traditional (extensive) grassland management. The Scheme has two packages: for grassland management and species-rich grasslands- and provides payments for mowing and grazing. \r\n6. Biodiversity Scheme\r\nThis consists of five packages: the Meadow Orchards Package; Local Breeds and Traditional Varieties Package; Countryside Stewardship Package; Wild Species Protection and Carp Fish Ponds Package. These are targeted to improve habitat, species and landscape biodiversity.\r\nMost of the proposed packages are horizontal measures and can be practised in all regions. However, the Species-Rich Grassland, Wild Species Protection and Carp Fish Ponds Packages are site-specific and can be applied only in selected areas. \r\n\r\nOnly farms that are bigger than 3 hectares and inscribed in the Farm Register should be eligible for support under the AE Programme. These farms manage 87% of the Croatian UAA. The only exceptions are farms in protected natural areas and organic farms, whose size can be smaller. It is estimated that some 2-10% of arable land and 20% of grassland would take part in the Programme, while the target for organic agriculture is 3% of the UAA. The Biodiversity Scheme is hopped to occupy 23,000 hectares, involve 2.5% of all livestock units and provide 175 km under linear habitats. The envisaged cost for the first three years of the AE Programme's implementation is 23 million EUR per year on average, representing some 7% of the current budget for the state's support for agriculture. Once Croatia joins the EU, the AE Programme could be 85% financed by the EU and 15% by the national agricultural budget. \r\n\r\nReaching the targets set out by this Programme would enhance the rural landscape, protect the environment, improve biodiversity and maintain Croatia's rich natural heritage. Therefore, this Programme should be given a prominent place when designing Croatia’s future agricultural policy.","citation":"Darko Znaor & Sonja Karoglan Todorović (2004)","page":1}

is a signatory to the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD). This is a reflection of the country's commitment to the conservation and sustainable management of biodiversity. Further, in decision V1/26 the Conference of Parties, in which Uganda participated, adopted the strategic plan for the CBD. Parties committed themselves to a more effective and coherent implementation of the objectives of the convention to achieve, by 2010, a significant reduction in the current rate of biodiversity loss at the global, regional and national level, as a contribution to poverty alleviation and to the benefit of all. In recent years, national policies have been reviewed by the line ministries and/or lead agencies to ensure that they conform to the provisions of CBD. Below ground biodiversity (BGBD) contributes a wide range of essential services to the sustainable functions of all ecosystems, by acting as the primary driving agents of nutrient cycling, regulating the dynamics of soil organic matter, soil carbon sequestration and greenhouse gas emission, modifying soil physical structure and water regime, enhancing the amount and efficiency of nutrient acquisition by the vegetation through mycorrhiza and nitrogen fixing bacteria and influencing plant health through the interaction of pathogens and pests with natural predators and parasites. These services are not only essential to the function of natural ecosystems but also constitute an important resource for the sustainable management of agricultural ecosystems. One of the activities undertaken during the project development process was country documentation of the state of knowledge on the issues related to conservation and management of below ground diversity and capacity building. This publication consists of five papers, each addressing a key BGBD functional group. The first deals with macrofauna, the second with soil pests and pathogens, the third with rhizosphere microbiota, the fourth with soil macrosymbionts and the fifth with decomposer microbiota. The publication will no doubt guide the formulation of strategies for conservation and sustainable management of BGBD in Uganda. The publication presents part of the findings of the global project Conservation and Management of BGBD (CSM-BGBD). The project is implemented in seven tropical countries, namely Brazil, Cote d'Ivore, India, Indonesia, Kenya, Mexico and Uganda. It is executed by TSBF-CIAT, with co-financing from the Global Environmental Facility and implementation support from the United Nations Environmental Programme.

paper gives an account of the environmental issues faced by the countries in Latin America and the Caribbean region, and, illustrates the Bank's work through strategies, and projects that countries are implementing. The first section emphasizes that good economic policy, frequently is good environmental policy, in spite of potential conflicts between economic, and environmental objectives, since both can be managed simultaneously. Because experience suggests that governments need to use both market-based incentives, and regulations, the second section discusses situations where incentives work best where regulation is essential, and where the two need to be combined. The third section analyzes how to set the right priorities, and how to choose policies and projects where conflict needs to be resolved, i.e., with improved data and knowledge, cost-benefit analysis can help assess the trade-offs. The fourth section stresses the urgency of strengthening institutions, and improving people's participation in projects. Adequate legislation needs to be in place, and be translated into sector-specific regulations. The final section looks at what is being done in the region to address global environment, such as biodiversity and global warming, highlighting the need for global finance to solve global problems.","citation":"John Dixon et al.

of ecological goods and services at the local level is often related to benefits at higher governmental levels. On the one hand, sustainable watershed management and biodiversity conservation are strongly connected to local land-use decisions. On the other hand, related conservation activities and protected areas are frequently associated with regional, national or even global public goods. Therefore, spatial externalities or spillover effects exist that – if not adequately compensated – lead to an under-provision of the public goods and services concerned. This chapter investigates fiscal transfers as an innovative instrument for compensating local jurisdictions for the ecological goods and services they provide across local boundaries. From a public finance perspective, fiscal transfers are a suitable instrument for internalising spatial externalities. A case study is presented that investigates the present and potential use of fiscal transfers for ecological public functions in the German federal systems. Analysis of the German system of fiscal equalisation at the local level shows that, so far, mostly end-of-the-pipe activities are currently considered with resource protection and nature conservation being widely underrepresented.","citation":"Irene Ring (2007)","page":1}

Instituto Nacional de Biodiversidad (INBio) is a non-profit making scientific institution with social orientation, created in 1989, whose main mission is to promote a new awareness of the value of biodiversity and thereby achieve its conservation in Costa Rica. The nematode subprogram was initiated officially in 1998 in close cooperation with the Universidad Nacional of Heredia and financed by the Netherlands government. We conducted a nematode inventory in five conservation areas of Costa Rica, chosen because they contain the most representative and diverse ecosystems of the country. Several hundred samples were collected and referenced with a GPS navigator. All contrasting morphotypes from each sample were represented and stored permanently on Cobb’s slides. The reference nematode collection of INBio contains 18 844 specimens, distributed as follows: Dorylamida (39.6%), Rhab-ditida (17.8%), Araeolaimida (10.3%), Tylenchida (9.0%), Enoplida (9.4%), Mononchida (8.8%), Chromadorida (1.8%), Aphelenchida (2.1%), Monhys-terida (1.1%) and Mermithida (0.2%). Most of the collection is identified at genus level; only 7% is identified at species level of which 14 are new to science. The interaction with international taxonomists is essential to both train INBio staff and generate knowledge related to tropical nematode diversity.","citation":"Alejandro Esquivel & Hans Arias (2004)","page":1}

Analyses of complex microbial communities are becoming increasingly important. Bottlenecks in these analyses, however, are the tools to actually describe the biodiversity. Novel protocols for a DNA array based analyzes of microbial communities are presented. In these protocols, the specificity obtained by sequence-specific labeling of DNA probes is combined with the possibility of detecting several different probes simultaneously by DNA array hybridization. The gene encoding 16S ribosomal RNA was chosen as the target in these analyses. This gene contains both universally conserved regions, and regions with relatively high variability. The universally conserved regions are used for PCR amplification primers, while the variable regions are used for the specific probes. Arrays prepared on positively charged nylon membranes and coated glass slides were compared. The advantage of using membranes is that chromogenic signal amplification can be used for the detection. Furthermore, the chromogenic detection does not require any sophisticated equipment. The advantage of the glass slides is that multiple fluorescence colors can be detected simultaneously, and that internal controls can be used for normalization. This approach is also suited for high throughput screenings.

farming is the form of agriculture that relies on techniques such as crop rotation, green manure, compost and biological pest control to maintain soil productivity and control pests on a farm. Organic farming excludes or strictly limits the use of manufactured fertilizers and pesticides, plant growth regulators such as hormones, livestock antibiotics, food additives, and genetically modified organisms. Organic agriculture is a production system that sustains the health of soils, ecosystems and people. It relies on ecological processes, biodiversity and cycles adapted to local conditions, rather than the use of inputs with adverse effects. Organic agriculture combines tradition, innovation and science to benefit the shared environment and promote fair relationships and a good quality of life for all involved. In 2010, we organised a bi- factorial trial at the Didactic Station in Timisoara in which we monitored maize yield with permanent vegetal cover technology compared to classical cultivation technology with mineral and organic fertilisation. Results show that there are no statistically ensured yield differences. There were significant differences between expenses and profit levels. Rezults show that in the Banat 's conditions, alternative technological variants are a solution from the point of new of enviromental - friendly agriculture. The technology of cultivation with permanent vegetal cover can be a solution for the cultivation of maize in Western Romania. The results of the present study are part of a research project PN II IDEI Contract nr. 1093/2009, topic code ID_863, financed by the Ministry of Education, Research, Youth and Sport, through the National Council of Scientific Research in Higher Education. The topic of the project is  Research, fundamenting and elaborating of the technological variant of ecologically planted corn and sunflower .","citation":"Daniel Gros & Bucur Vukasin (2010)","page":1}

essay examines the issues of equity and efficiency in the use of global environmental resources, with the atmosphere as a case in point. It shows a somewhat unexpected connection between the two issues in the context of international greenhouse gas emissions trading markets. Contrary to common wisdom, achieving a more even distribution of property rights to environmental assets is more than a matter of equity. Property rights also influence market efficiency. I show that a precondition for market efficiency is that more property rights in the global commons should be given to those regions that own fewer private goods. This connection leads to recommendations to implement the greenhouse gas emissions trading regimes authorized by the Kyoto Protocol to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (FCCC). In order to ensure an efficient trading market, developing countries should be allocated proportionately more emissions rights than industrial countries. In addition, there is a need to create an International Bank for Environmental Settlements (IBES) as a self-financing institution that can obtain market value from environmental resources while preserving them. Emissions trading, the global reinsurance of environmental risks, and securitization of the earth's biodiversity resources are financial instruments that merge the interests of the private financial markets with international sustainable development policy. These instruments and institutions should help to redefine economic progress in a way that is compatible with a harmonious use of the world's resources and with equity among rich and poor nations.","citation":"Graciela Chichilnisky (2000)","page":1}

in Conservation Biology in Southern California I. Current Extinction Rates and Causes Tracy Tennant, Michael F. Allen, Fred Edwards Center for Conservation Biology University of California, Riverside July 12, 2001 The state of California houses some of the highest levels of species richness in the world. The California floristic province is considered one of the 18 global biodiversity hot-spots (Wilson 1992). More than one quarter of all plant species found north of Mexico are native to California and about half of these are found only in California. Further, it is estimated that there may be as much as 700 endemic 1 species in the Southern California area and several entire endemic families of invertebrates, vertebrates, and Anniellidae (legless lizards) (Scott, T.A. 2 , personal communication). Based simply on the numbers of species in California, many are likely at risk to becoming threatened, endangered, or extinct. County population (X 1000) Riverside San Bernardino Figure 1. Human population changes and projections in Riverside and San Bernardino Counties. California remains also among the fastest growing states. The human population has been growing rapidly since the gold rush of the 1850’s and, at the decadal time scale, shows no signs of slowing down. The 1998 data from the California Department of Finance suggests the state population of 29.9 million in 1990 will nearly double to 58.7 million by 2040. In Riverside and San Bernardino counties alone, the population is expected to increase by 3.5 to 4-fold (Fig 1). The high number of endemic species with small and Reported no. of extinct species restricted distributions in California means that species Predicted no. of extinct species extinctions will likely be more severe in this state before the rest of the continental U.S. For example, as a result of the reduced number of year-round flowing streams in Southern California, most native freshwater Date fish are now extinct, rare or endangered (Swift et al. Figure 2. Rate of animal species extinctions in California over the 1993). To estimate the rate of animal species past 200 years. extinctions in California, we plotted the cumulative number of extinct animal species against time (Fig 2) using a database compiled by the California State Fish and Game. The data set covers the last 200 years, but it is possible that Native Americans had an Populations native and restricted to a specific region - Not naturally occurring outside a particular region. Scott, T.A., University of California, Riverside, Department of Earth Sciences. ExtinctionFinal2.doc Number of animal species extinct/extirpated Given the unique biological richness and human population pressures in California, the rate of species extinctions in the state may serve as a useful indicator of where species conservation is headed in the rest of the continental U.S. To evaluate this, we examined the rate of animal extinctions in California using data compiled by the California Department of Fish and Game (Wildlife and Habitat Data Analysis Branch), and the rate at which plant and animal species in Regression Equation: California were listed as threatened or endangered y = 57.6942/(1 + e (-(x-1954.9934)/23.4023)) (using U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service data).

R. DeSombre, Global Environmental Institutions (New York: Routledge, 2006). James Gustave Speth and Peter M. Haas, Global Environmental Governance (Washington, DC: Island Press, 2006). Pamela S. Chasek, David L. Downie, and Janet Welsh Brown, Global Environmental Politics, 4th ed. (Boulder: Westview Press, 2006). Richard E. Saunier and Richard A. Meganck, Dictionary and Introduction to Global Environmental Governance (London: Earthscan, 2007). Global environmental governance has emerged as a hot topic in scholarly circles. The manifest inadequacy of international policy cooperation in response to transboundary pollution problems and the need for better management of shared natural resources has led to a flurry of academic writing. Scholars in environmental studies, political science, international relations, and law are now critically analyzing the structure and effectiveness of the international environmental regime and efforts to address change, declining fisheries, deforestation, loss of biodiversity, the spread of toxic chemicals, and other issues. These problems have also captured attention in the public arena. Al Gore won the Nobel Peace Prize for his efforts to focus the public on the climate crisis. His book An Inconvenient Truth and related movie have won numerous awards. Adding to this arc of interest, a number of scholarly books that seek to illuminate the institutions, legal structures, and politics that shape global-scale environmental policymaking have been released over the past several years. The logic of collective action in the international environmental arena is clear. Absent cooperation, the spillover of pollution from one country onto its neighbors or into the shared space of the global commons, as well as the over-exploitation of shared natural resources, promise not just environmental degradation but also economic inefficiency, political instability, and diminished social welfare. Ecological interdependence, expanded economic inter-linkages, and tensions at the trade-environment interface have also made environmental cooperation an important element in the process of establishing the terms of engagement for international commerce. (1) The world community's failure to stem the buildup of greenhouse gas emissions in the atmosphere and resulting fears that the world is suffering the effects of change--global warming, sea level rise, increased intensity of windstorms, changed rainfall patterns, and other problems--add urgency to the quest for a better-functioning international environmental regime. All of the books surveyed in the following paragraphs find negative trend lines with regard to environmental cooperation, with the exception of efforts to phase out chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and other chemicals that destroy the ozone layer. Understanding which international environmental efforts are effective--and why--thus takes on a degree of urgency among issues of global policymaking. Unfortunately, these recent books, while beginning to explore the contours of this important question, do too little to help us understand how to move forward and build a more effective international environmental regime. Nevertheless, the works reviewed provide an important starting point for this critical inquiry. Elizabeth DeSombre's Global Environmental Institutions offers a thorough tour of the existing structure of environment-related international organizations. As part of the Global Institutions Series, edited by Thomas Weiss and Rorden Wilkinson, the book provides a useful history of the UN Environment Programme (UNEP), although some of the details of her analysis have been disputed. (2) DeSombre illuminates the governance, financing, and scientific efforts of UNEP and also reviews the Earth Summits, (3) which have helped structure the international community's thinking about environmental challenges over the past forty years. …","citation":"Daniel C.
