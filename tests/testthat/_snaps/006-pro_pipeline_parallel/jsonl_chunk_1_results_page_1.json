latest update of their aggregate governance indicators, together with new analysis of several issues related to the use of these measures. The governance indicators measure the following six dimensions of governance: (1) voice and accountability; (2) political instability and violence; (3) government effectiveness; (4) regulatory quality; (5) rule of law, and (6) control of corruption. They cover 209 countries and territories for 1996, 1998, 2000, 2002, and 2004. They are based on several hundred individual variables measuring perceptions of governance, drawn from 37 separate data sources constructed by 31 organizations. The authors present estimates of the six dimensions of governance for each period, as well as margins of error capturing the range of likely values for each country. These margins of error are not unique to perceptions-based measures of governance, but are an important feature of all efforts to measure governance, including objective indicators. In fact, the authors give examples of how individual objective measures provide an incomplete picture of even the quite particular dimensions of governance that they are intended to measure. The authors also analyze in detail changes over time in their estimates of governance; provide a framework for assessing the statistical significance of changes in governance; and suggest a simple rule of thumb for identifying statistically significant changes in country governance over time. The ability to identify significant changes in governance over time is much higher for aggregate indicators than for any individual indicator. While the authors find that the quality of governance in a number of countries has changed significantly (in both directions), they also provide evidence suggesting that there are no trends, for better or worse, in global averages of governance. Finally, they interpret the strong observed correlation between income and governance, and argue against recent efforts to apply a discount to governance performance in low-income countries.

The World Development Report 1992 explores the links between economic development and the environment. The 1990 report on poverty, last year's report on development strategies, and this report constitute a trilogy on the goals and means of development. The main message of this year's report is the need to integrate environmental considerations into development policymaking. The report argues that continued, and even accelerated, economic and human development is sustainable and can be consistent with improving environmental conditions, but that this will require major policy, program, and institutional shifts. A twofold strategy is required. First, the positive links between efficient income growth and the environment need to be aggressively exploited. Second, strong policies and institutions need to be put in place which cause decision makers to adopt less damaging forms of behavior. Where tradeoffs exist between income growth and environmental quality, the report argues for a careful assessment of the costs and benefits of alternative policies. This approach will result in much less environmental damage. Like its predecessors, this report includes the World Development Indicators, which offer selected social and economic statistics on 125 countries.

major challenge in tropical land management is to meet the ever-growing demand for agricultural products while conserving biodiversity, providing critical ecosystem services, and maintaining rural livelihoods. This challenge is particularly acute in the Mesoamerican biodiversity hotspot, a region of high conservation value for both wild and domesticated species that is undergoing rapid human population growth, ecological degradation, and loss of traditional farming systems (Myers et al. 2000; Harvey et al. 2005a). Approximately 80% of the region's vegetation has been converted to agriculture, threatening biodiversity. More than 300 of the region's endemic species of flora and fauna are threatened, including at least 107 that are critically endangered (CI 2007). With continuing habitat loss (deforestation is 1.2%/year in Central America and Mexico combined; FAO 2005) and fragmentation of remaining forests, pressure on the region's biodiversity will intensify. Habitat destruction and fragmentation are not the only drivers of biodiversity loss in the region, however. Globalization of market forces, agricultural industrialization, migration, public policy, and cultural changes are driving the transformation of diverse, traditional, smallholder agroecosystems into agroindustrial systems dependent on chemical inputs and mechanization (Conway & Rosset 1996; Perfecto et al. 1996; Angelsen & Kaimowitz 2001). Agroindustrial intensification is often accompanied by significant reductions in tree cover, fallow vegetation, habitat diversity, and forest connectivity. These transformations directly threaten species dependent on natural habitat and undermine indigenous management practices that coevolved with this biodiversity for over 10,000 years (Nigh & Levy Tacher 2008). Despite considerable efforts to protect biodiversity in reserves and parks in Mesoamerica, many of these refuges are small, fragmented, isolated, or poorly protected (Miller et al. 2001), and not all ecosystems or species are represented adequately (Powell et al. 2000; Rodrigues et al. 2004). Besides having inadequate dimensions, most protected areas are embedded within an agricultural landscape, and existing buffer zones are inadequate to alleviate effects of fragmentation, contamination by agrochemicals, hunting, and unsustainable or illegal logging (DeFries et al. 2005). The fate of biodiversity within protected areas is therefore inextricably linked to the broader landscape context, including how the surrounding agricultural matrix is designed and managed (Wallace et al. 2005; Vandermeer et al. 2007). Protecting biodiversity while sustaining agricultural productivity, indigenous cultures, and rural livelihoods, requires a new approach to conservation, particularly in regions such as Mesoamerica, where substantial habitat conversion has already occurred. In contrast to the prevailing trend of managing protected areas and productive lands separately, we propose integrated landscape management in which conservation and production units within the agricultural matrix are managed jointly for long-term sustainability. We do not advocate agricultural intensification to spare further forest conversion (e.g., Green et al. 2005) because this approach is unlikely to have the intended outcome, for reasons discussed elsewhere (Vandermeer & Perfecto 2005, 2007; Matson & Vitousek 2006). Instead conservation efforts should be based on the recognition that how agriculture is conducted and how different land uses are distributed spatially and temporally determine the region's biodiversity (Perfecto & Vandermeer 1997; McNeely & Scherr 2003). Lasting conservation will therefore require alliances among conservation biologists, farmers, and land managers to actively plan the future of Mesoamerican landscapes. Here we use an integrated landscape approach to highlight opportunities for achieving long-term conservation in Mesoamerica. We provide an overview of the potential for agricultural landscapes and traditional smallholder farming to conserve biodiversity, propose an urgent action agenda to guide conservation in agricultural landscapes and stem the loss of biodiversity and traditional farming systems, and outline key socioeconomic, legal, and political conditions needed for successful implementation of the action plan. Although our examples and recommendations focus on Mesoamerica, our approach is relevant to other regions where there are similar challenges to conserving biodiversity in human-modified landscapes. An increasing number of studies in Mesoamerica show that certain agricultural landscapes and traditional smallholder practices contribute to biodiversity conservation (e.g., Estrada & Coates-Estrada 2002; Daily et al. 2003; Mayfield & Daily 2005) and at the same time contribute to increased food production and rural income (Pretty et al. 2003). In particular, heterogeneous agricultural landscapes that retain abundant tree cover (as forest fragments, fallows, riparian areas, live fences, dispersed trees, or shade canopies) provide complementary habitats, resources, and landscape connectivity for a significant portion of the original biota (e.g., Harvey et al. 2006a; Sekercioglu et al. 2007). Landscape configurations that connect forest patches, maintain a diverse array of habitats, and retain high structural and floristic complexity generally conserve more species than landscapes lacking connectivity or habitat complexity (Benton et al. 2003; Bennett et al. 2006). In addition, agricultural landscapes with abundant tree cover serve as buffers for remaining natural areas (Wallace et al. 2005) and contribute regionally to the maintenance of important ecosystem services, such as natural pest management, carbon sequestration, and water and soil conservation (Daily 1997; Soto-Pinto et al. 2002). Within agricultural landscapes, forested and nonforested habitats contribute to biodiversity conservation. Forest fragments, riparian forests, tree plantations, and other types of remnant and introduced tree cover serve as habitats for many species, enhance landscape connectivity, and retain potential for forest regeneration and restoration (Chazdon 2003; Harvey et al. 2006a). Nevertheless, other types of land uses, such as diverse coffee agroforestry (e.g., Moguel & Toledo 1999; Komar 2006), cocoa agroforestry (Rice & Greenberg 2000; Harvey et al. 2006b), silvopastoral systems (Harvey et al. 2005b, 2006a), and traditional agroecological land uses (such as diverse polycultures, organic farming, and swidden agriculture; Finegan & Nasi 2004) also harbor high levels of both wild and agricultural biodiversity and offer much greater conservation value than the agroindustrial systems that typically replace them. In general, biodiversity-friendly land uses are those that mimic the structural and floristic diversity of native vegetation and rely the least on agrochemicals (Tscharntke et al. 2005). The diverse agroecology systems and landscapes described above are typically (but not always) managed by smallholders (campesinos) and indigenous farmers. Although most environmentally friendly farming practices are not scale-specific in principle, landscapes that are composed of many small farms often demonstrate a high potential for sustaining both biodiversity and rural livelihoods (Rosset 1999). Small farmers are more likely to know their land intimately, embrace complexity and multifunctionality, retain multiple traditional varieties, focus on inputs of knowledge and labor rather than purchased agrochemicals and mechanization, and grow food for nearby consumption instead of commodities for export (Netting 1993; Nazarea 2006). Thus, conservation of biodiversity will often be well served by policies that favor smallholders, promote diverse farming landscapes, and support dissemination of traditional practices and agroecological knowledge (Castillo & Toledo 2000). On the basis of existing evidence and experiences, we propose an action agenda to seize opportunities to reconcile farming and biodiversity conservation and to respond to the immediate threats of biodiversity loss and unsustainable farming. The goal of the action agenda is to achieve sustainable and resilient landscapes in which conservation and agricultural production objectives are accomplished in mutually reinforcing ways. The specific conservation goals are to conserve plant and animal biodiversity; maintain intact habitats, ecological communities, and ecosystem functions; buffer existing protected areas; maintain landscape connectivity; and retain landscape resilience to disturbance and climate change. The agricultural goals are to fulfill human livelihood needs, sustain yields, conserve indigenous and smallholder agroecosystems and associated knowledge and culture, diversify products, minimize reliance on external inputs, and reduce vulnerability to natural disasters and climate change. Our action agenda contains six strategies (Table 1). The first consists of working with stakeholders in a participatory approach to identify priority landscapes where action for conservation and agricultural sustainability will bring the greatest results. Numerous tools already identify areas with high conservation value and the greatest need for protection (e.g., key biodiversity areas [Eken et al. 2004] and priority ecoregions [Olson & Dinerstein 2002]), but these tools rarely include information on rural livelihoods and agricultural systems. We advocate combining the analysis of biodiversity hotspots (Myers et al. 2000) with the identification of rural hotspots, where traditional smallholder livelihoods are most vulnerable and where agroecological systems and knowledge are being rapidly lost. This approach would allow the identification of landscapes where conservation priorities and rural development priorities overlap and where integration is most likely to succeed. Landscapes that are likely to emerge as priorities include those located near protected areas or in key biological corridors, those that conserve high diversity of traditional and indigenous crops, and those with high forest and tree cover that are being rapidly encroached upon by intensive agriculture or urbanization. In contrast, agricultural landscapes that are already dominated by agroindustrial production (such as industrially grown sugarcane, pineapple, or banana) are less likely to warrant attention because the chances of reconciling farming and biodiversity conservation there are slim. The second strategy is to address major threats to biodiversity within priority landscapes. Common threats include illegal logging, irresponsible use of agrochemicals, forest degradation by cattle grazing, shortening of fallows, unsustainable collection of firewood and other products, and conversion of diversified agricultural systems to agroindustrial monocultures with low biodiversity value (Carrillo & Vaughan 1994; Harvey et al. 2005a). Measures should be taken to mitigate these threats. For example, planting multipurpose trees on farms offers an alternative to firewood extraction from native forests (Barrance & Hellin 2003); integrated fire management (including prescribed burns, establishment of fire breaks, and training in sensible fire use) reduces unintended burning of native forests (Myers 2006); and adopting organic practices and integrated pest management can reduce dependence on pesticides (Kogan 1998; Morales & Perfecto 2000). Nevertheless, these promising approaches need to be applied systematically over large areas, with active participation and leadership of local rural communities (Nelson 1994). The protection of remaining native habitat (whether intact forest, wetland, or grassland) constitutes the third key strategy for conserving biodiversity and maintaining rural livelihoods in agricultural landscapes. Native habitat protection should continue to form the cornerstone of conservation activities because they provide resources to native species, maintain intact ecological communities, serve as genetic sources for recolonization of the agricultural matrix, and buffer against extreme weather events and climate change (Bengtsson et al. 2003; Taberelli & Gascon 2005). Large, contiguous areas of native habitat and vegetation along riparian areas (that form natural corridors) are of particularly high conservation value and should be priorities. Nevertheless, even small (<5 ha) and degraded forest patches can be important for some species, providing additional resources and landscape connectivity (Sekercioglu et al. 2007). Protecting native habitats within the agricultural landscape also benefits rural communities by providing products and ecosystem services such as pollination, pest management, flood control, and nutrient cycling on which agricultural systems (and farmers) depend (Ricketts 2004; Naidoo & Ricketts 2006). A fourth key strategy is to protect, diversify, and sustainably manage the heterogeneous tree cover within the agricultural matrix. On-farm tree cover contributes to biodiversity conservation by providing additional habitats and resources for plant and animal species and enhancing landscape connectivity (Schroth et al. 2004; Harvey et al. 2005b). In addition, tree cover in pastures and fields confers benefits to farmers, providing products (fruit, wood, fodder for livestock), ameliorating microclimatic conditions, and increasing soil fertility (Nair 1989). Nevertheles, trees may also reduce agricultural productivity through competition for light, water, and nutrients and serve as hosts for pest species (Ong & Huxley 1996). A key challenge is therefore to integrate tree species in densities and spatial arrangements that minimize competition and shading of agricultural land, yet still provide biodiversity benefits. Low densities of trees scattered across the agricultural matrix and linear plantings of trees along farm and field boundaries are often compatible with existing production systems and therefore are easily adopted by farmers (Harvey et al. 2005b). A fifth strategy is to promote and conserve traditional and ecologically based agricultural practices and indigenous knowledge practices, such as agroforestry, swidden agriculture, home gardens, low-input agriculture, polycultures, and traditional milpas. These agroecological systems conserve high levels of both agrobiodiversity and wild biodiversity, ensure better soil management, and minimize agrochemical use. Throughout Mesoamerica, numerous academic, governmental, and nongovernmental organizations (e.g., CATIE, ECOSUR, EARTH, Campesino a Campesino, PROMECAFE, ACICAFOC, Sustainable Agriculture Network; Harvey et al. 2005a) already promote the use of ecological agriculture and traditional knowledge, but these efforts need to be scaled up to cover a greater proportion of the region's agricultural lands and communities. Last, agricultural land that is highly degraded, unproductive, or unsuitable (e.g., prone to erosion or colonized by exotic species) should be reforested or allowed to regenerate naturally (Montagnini 2001; Lamb et al. 2005). Restoration goals can range from restoring soil fertility for agricultural use to establishing tree plantations or forests for timber or biodiversity conservation. Reforestation efforts should include diverse mixtures of native tree species, including species that provide resources to wildlife and species that have high timber value and provide future income to local farmers. Information on many native species that could be used in large-scale restoration efforts is available (e.g., Hooper et al. 2002; Wishnie et al. 2007). Restoration can also be achieved through natural regeneration, especially where remaining tree cover provides a source of propagules. Natural regeneration can be facilitated by fencing off areas to prevent cattle entry (Guevara et al. 2004), permitting light grazing to reduce competition from grasses on tree seedlings (Posada et al. 2000), using cattle to disperse tree seeds (Miceli-Méndez et al. 2007), or retaining isolated trees or live fences that serve as nuclei for natural regeneration (Slocum 2001; Zahawi & Augspurger 2006). The use of enrichment planting in fallows can also facilitate soil restoration (Finegan & Nasi 2004). An efficient implementation of the six strategies outlined above requires that certain enabling conditions be in place at local, regional, and/or national levels. We focus here on 5 major types of programs that could facilitate our agenda: providing economic incentives, strengthening and enforcing legislation, encouraging farmer alliances, promoting sustainable agriculture certification programs, and ensuring political support (Table 2). A variety of economic instruments can be used to encourage farmers to conserve forests, retain tree cover, adopt biodiversity-friendly cropping systems, and to cover additional costs these activities may involve. Payments for environmental services (PES) hold particular promise. A Costa Rican PES scheme, in which farmers receive payments for protecting existing forest and for integrating trees into their farming systems, has worked well (Pagiola et al. 2005a; Zbinden & Lee 2005) and similar schemes are now being applied in Honduras, Guatemala, Mexico, and Nicaragua (Kosoy et al. 2007). Although PES schemes appear to be successful in conserving forest cover, they could have a greater positive impact on rural landscapes and livelihoods if they included payments for a greater diversity of sustainable land uses, removed inappropriate access restrictions (such as minimum land size), lowered transaction costs, and carefully targeted priority landscapes that have the greatest potential to conserve both biodiversity and rural livelihoods (Grieg-Gran et al. 2005; Pagiola et al. 2005b). Another economic tool with potential to reduce the conflict between conservation and farming is carbon financing for either enhancing carbon sequestration (e.g., reforestation, agroforestry, and improved agricultural land management) or reducing emissions from deforestation (Orlando et al. 2002; Moutinho & Schwartzman 2005). Reforestation activities are already eligible for funding under the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) of the Kyoto Protocol, and the rapidly expanding voluntary markets for carbon offer new opportunities for forest restoration and conservation (Bayon et al. 2007). The complexity and high costs of CDM projects have so far generally precluded small landowners and farmer organizations from participating (Boyd et al. 2007), but as the carbon market matures and demand for forestry carbon increases, so will opportunities for farmers. Innovative initiatives, such as the Plan Vivo project in Mexico, which provides smallholder farmers with access to carbon markets, are already paving the way (de Jong et al. 1997; Klooster & Masera 2000). In addition to creating economic incentives, our action agenda requires increasing law enforcement and developing new legislation that restricts deforestation, regulates logging and agrochemical use, oversees zoning regulations and land tenure issues, and promotes conservation of secondary forests, riparian vegetation, and on-farm tree cover (Cullen et al. 2005; Wallace et al. 2005). The 1996 Forestry Law of Costa Rica serves as a model of what can be achieved in the region: the law carefully defines forest (in terms of percent canopy and area), bans forest conversion to other land uses, restricts logging within 15–50 m (depending on slope) on either side of rivers, and establishes the framework for the PES scheme that pays landowners for forest conservation and reforestation (Asamblea Legislativa 1996). Drafting appropriate legislation is only the first step, however; without enforcement, laws are ineffective. Illegal logging recently accounted for 75–85% of hardwood production in Honduras and nearly 50% in Nicaragua (Richards et al. 2003). Increasing enforcement of forestry and environmental laws by systematically monitoring forest cover, applying penalties, and properly managing harvesting permits is critical for forest conservation. In addition, legislation that facilitates the establishment of private reserves, conservation easements, buffer zones, and conservation corridors will likely encourage natural habitat conservation on private lands (Langholz et al. 2000; Wallace et al. 2005). The strengthening of alliances among farmers, agronomists, extension workers, foresters, and conservation biologists will also promote ecologically sustainable production systems and lead to genuinely collaborative approaches to biodiversity conservation and food security (Morales et al. 2007; Vandermeer & Perfecto 2007). The active participation of the more than 12 million Mesoamerican farmers (CIA 2006) will be critical for long-term conservation gains. Many institutions, alliances, and networks that promote interdisciplinary partnerships already exist, but these often lack sufficient resources to be effective, cover only a small proportion of the region's stakeholders, or have more-limited agendas than the integrated approach we advocate. Funds are urgently required to support these types of organizations and regional initiatives. Our action agenda could also be enabled by efforts to link small farmers with niche markets for agricultural and forest commodities that have been produced with minimal negative impact on biodiversity. These biodiversity-friendly enterprises are largely supported by private-sector certification programs led by Rainforest Alliance, Fair Trade, Smithsonian Migratory Bird Center, International Federation of Organic Agriculture Movements, Forest Stewardship Council, and others (Gullison 2003; Raynolds et al. 2007). Most of the schemes require producers to comply with environmental standards, such as planting trees along roads, controlling erosion, limiting agrochemical use, and planting native vegetation along rivers. Many also protect farm workers and ensure they are paid fair wages, enjoy safe working conditions, and drink clean water. Nevertheless, compliance or enforcement of standards is often weak, transaction costs and paperwork often limit participation, and incentives are insufficient to attract high levels of participation (Gullison 2003; Molnar 2003). Finally, broad political support at all levels is needed to catalyze the strategies outlined here. Already, there are positive signs that Mesoamerican governments are aware of the importance of biodiversity conservation and the need to link conservation with sustainable rural development. All Mesoamerican countries are signatories of the Convention on Biological Diversity and have thus agreed to develop biodiversity action plans that ensure protection and sustainable use of biodiversity (CBD 2005). In addition, there are many regional programs (e.g., Plan Ambiental de la Región Centroamericana, Estratégia Forestal Centroamericana, and Iniciativa Mesoamericana de Desarrollo Sostenible) and even a Regional Institute for Biodiversity (created in 2005) that address, to some degree, the need for reconciling biodiversity conservation and rural development. The countries have also collaborated to develop the Mesoamerican Biological Corridor, an effort to link existing protected areas within and between countries to facilitate movement of plant and animal species (Miller et al. 2001). To be successful, this large-scale initiative will require the careful management of the agricultural landscapes in which the protected areas are embedded and will depend on the strategies outlined in our agenda. Yet despite the generally positive and promising political arena, there is a dearth of action on the ground. In many cases the political will has not yet been translated into concrete actions, funding for implementation is inadequate, and support for technical assistance and capacity building is lacking. Governments must place greater attention on implementing their vision for sustainable development in rural regions with adequate resources and knowledge. We call for a new approach to biodiversity conservation within human-dominated Mesoamerican landscapes—one that unites a focus on ecologically sustainable agriculture with existing efforts in protected areas to achieve lasting conservation outcomes at local and regional levels. This new approach recognizes farmers as stakeholders in conserving biodiversity and actively solicits farmers as partners to create resilient landscapes that foster wildlife and preserve rural livelihoods and local knowledge. Our action agenda provides strategies for reconciling farming and conservation and identifies key socioeconomic, legal, and political actions that could enable their adoption. If implemented broadly, our agenda could catalyze significant positive changes for both conservation and farming. Action is urgently needed, however. Landscapes may soon be so degraded that conservation and restoration will no longer be effective, and traditional knowledge may be lost forever. We therefore urgently call conservationists, agronomists, farmers, decision makers, and other stakeholders to actively design and manage entire landscapes to secure a future for both biodiversity and rural livelihoods in Mesoamerica.

increases in prices of staple foods raise the real incomes of those selling food, many of whom are relatively poor, while hurting net food consumers, many of whom are also relatively poor. The impacts on poverty will certainly be very diverse, but the average impact on poverty depends upon the balance between these two effects, and can only be determined by looking at real-world data. Results using household data for ten observations on nine low-income countries show that the short-run impacts of higher staple food prices on poverty differ considerably by commodity and by country, but, that poverty increases are much more frequent, and larger, than poverty reductions. The recent large increases in food prices appear likely to raise overall poverty in low income countries substantially.

Part I reviews recent trends in the world economy and their implications for the future prospects of developing countries. Part II examines the role of public finance in development. This report includes the World Development Indicators, which provide selected social and economic indicators for more than 100 countries. Despite continued economic growth through 1987 and into 1988, two problems have characterized recent trends: unsustainable economic imbalances within and among industrial countries, and highly uneven economic growth among developing countries. Part I of the report concludes that three interdependent policy challenges need to be addressed. First, industrial countries need to reduce their external payments imbalances. Second, developing countries need to continue restructuring their domestic economic policies in order to gain creditworthiness and growth. Third, net resource transfers, external debt, from the developing countries must be trimmed so that investment and growth can resume. Part II of the report explores how public finance policies are best designed and implemented. How deficits are reduced is crucial: controlling costs in mobilizing revenues and setting careful priorities in public spending are equally important. Efficiency in providing public services and expanding the scope for raising revenue can be achieved through decentralizing decisionmaking and reforming state-owned enterprises with the latter permitting greater private participation.

Acknowledged by world leaders as a global problem, land degradation has been taken seriously in three ways: its extent and the proportion of the global population affected; international environmental policy responses; and its inter‐relation with other global environmental issues such as biodiversity. Messages about land degradation have, however, suffered from abuses, which have rendered appropriate policy responses ineffective. For control to be effective, the paper argues that the synergies between land degradation and the two other main global environmental change components (biodiversity and climate change) should be more fully exploited. A focus on the interlinkages, of which there are six possible permutations, is fully supported by empirical findings that suggest that land degradation control would not only technically be better served by addressing aspects of biodiversity and climate change but also that international financing mechanisms and the major donors would find this more acceptable. The DPSIR (Driving Force, Pressure, State, Impacts, Response) conceptual framework model is used to illustrate how land degradation control could be more effective, tackling not only the drivers of change but also major developmental issues such as poverty and food insecurity.

uman impacts on the environment are intensifying, raising vexing questions of how best to allocate the limited resources available for biodiversity conservation. Which creatures and places most deserve attention? Which should we ignore, potentially accepting their extinction? The answer to this dilemma depends on one's objectives. To motivate action, conservationists often mix diverse ethical and practical objectives, hoping they will reinforce each other. But attention given to one goal may instead diminish the prospects for achieving others.\n\nTo examine whether different objectives for conservation conflict with or reinforce each other, consider the two principal approaches that seem to differ most fundamentally in objective. Caricaturing slightly, the first is focused on biodiversity conservation for its own sake, independent of human needs or desires. The second is focused on safeguarding ecosystem services for humanity's sake: for the provision of goods, basic life-support services, and human enjoyment of nature.\n\nWe worry about the imbalance in attention devoted to these approaches: Most conservation research and funding are oriented toward biodiversity with, until recently, little tangible effort being directed toward ecosystem services. Although the latter are often used as a justification for the former, little is known about the circumstances under which the two approaches actually contribute to each other. Certainly the relative merit of alternative conservation goals is as much a matter of social choice as of scientific debate. Yet a well-integrated scientific framework for weighing their merits is key to decision-making, especially when these goals may be at odds.\n\nA wide range of priorities, and criteria for defining them, has been proposed for biodiversity conservation. By contrast, neither general priorities nor a methodology for establishing them have been systematically developed for safeguarding ecosystem services. Mapping the distribution of biodiversity and threats to it is a key tool for turning priorities into plans of action. Analogous maps of ecosystem services priorities, which would locate suppliers, consumers, and threats relevant to each service, are virtually nonexistent. Such a mapping process could illuminate several key things: (i) the levels and types of services supplied by alternative land management regimes; (ii) the degree of spatial congruence in the supply of different services; and (iii) forecasted changes both in services and in the societal need for them, under alternative future scenarios of demographic, land use, and climatic change.\n\nHow much are these two approaches likely to coincide? The degree of concordance will depend on complex, and at present little-understood, interactions between biodiversity and resultant ecosystem services. Many ecosystem services may be unaffected by small losses of biodiversity, but they may deteriorate rapidly when, for instance, most of the elements of a functional group are gone. The coincidence of the two strategies is likely to increase as (i) an increasing number of services is considered; (ii) functional redundancy is valued as a buffer against random natural events (such as drought) and ongoing anthropogenic change; and (iii) the relative weight placed on biodiversity-intensive services, such as aesthetic and option values, increases.\n\nFor any ecosystem service, however, the devil will be in the details. For instance, the relation between pollinator diversity and crop pollination in an area will depend on factors such as the efficiency of each pollinator species across crops, the dynamics of pollinator populations, and competition for pollinators between crops and noncrop plants. The relationship between biodiversity and productivity is similarly complex.\n\nYet policymakers require practical, defensible recommendations now. What can scientists offer? The Millennium Ecosystem Assessment aims to provide the first global appraisal of the condition and future prospects of ecosystems, and to build local and global capacity for evaluating the complex tradeoffs involved in managing ecosystems for either biodiversity conservation or safeguarding ecosystem services. Also promising is the development of creative conservation financing mechanisms that are aimed at both, such as the U.S. Nature Conservancy's Center for Innovative Conservation Finance.\n\nAbove all, we must remember that biodiversity is in serious jeopardy for a reason: namely, that the opportunity costs of conservation are perceived to be too high. The best hope for biodiversity is to create and align diverse incentives for conservation wherever possible and to integrate these into the larger policy-making arena.","citation":"Patricia Balvanera et al.

and aid recipients acknowledge the importance of good governance for development. This understanding has spurred an intense interest in more refined, nuanced, and policy-relevant indicators of governance. In this paper we review progress to date in the area of measuring governance, using a simple framework of analysis focusing on two key questions: (i) what do we measure? and, (ii) whose views do we rely on? For the former question, we distinguish between indicators measuring formal laws or rules 'on the books', and indicators that measure the practical application or outcomes of these rules 'on the ground', calling attention to the strengths and weaknesses of both types of indicators as well as the complementarities between them. For the latter question, we distinguish between experts and survey respondents on whose views governance assessments are based, again highlighting their advantages, disadvantages, and complementarities. We also review the merits of aggregate as opposed to individual governance indicators. We conclude with some simple principles to guide the refinement of existing governance indicators and the development of future indicators. We emphasize the need to: transparently disclose and account for the margins of error in all indicators; draw from a diversity of indicators and exploit complementarities among them; submit all indicators to rigorous public and academic scrutiny; and, in light of the lessons of over a decade of existing indicators, to be realistic in the expectations of future indicators.

has been touted as a source of finance for biodiversity conservation. Recent work has suggested that the bioprospecting value of the “marginal unit” of genetic resources is likely to be vanishingly small, creating essentially no conservation incentive. This result is shown to flow specifically from a stylized description of the research process as one of brute‐force testing, unaided by an organizing scientific framework. Scientific models channel research effort toward leads for which the expected productivity of discoveries is highest. Leads of unusual promise then command information rents, associated with their role in reducing the costs of search. When genetic materials are abundant, information rents are virtually unaffected by increases in the profitability of product discovery and decline as technology improvements lower search costs. Numerical simulation results suggest that, under plausible conditions, the bioprospecting value of certain genetic resources could be large enough to support market‐based conservation of biodiversity.","citation":"Gordon C.

service approaches to conservation are being championed as a new strategy for conservation, under the hypothesis that they will broaden and deepen support for biodiversity protection. Where traditional approaches focus on setting aside land by purchasing property rights, ecosystem service approaches aim to engage a much wider range of places, people, policies, and financial resources in conservation. This is particularly important given projected intensification of human impacts, with rapid growth in population size and individual aspirations. Here we use field research on 34 ecosystem service (ES) projects and 26 traditional biodiversity (BD) projects from the Western Hemisphere to test whether ecosystem service approaches show signs of realizing their putative potential. We find that the ES projects attract on average more than four times as much funding through greater corporate sponsorship and use of a wider variety of finance tools than BD projects. ES projects are also more likely to encompass working landscapes and the people in them. We also show that, despite previous concern, ES projects not only expand opportunities for conservation, but they are no less likely than BD projects to include or create protected areas. Moreover, they do not draw down limited financial resources for conservation but rather engage a more diverse set of funders.

New financing mechanisms for tropical forest conservation, based on payments for ecosystem services, often involve the development of new business models. Suppliers of ecosystem services may include existing land users (e.g., farmers, foresters, tourism operators) or new business ventures (e.g., carbon accountants and traders, conservation bankers). Developing viable business models for biodiversity conservation is a major challenge, due to: the complexity of biodiversity itself (i.e., genes, species, and ecosystems, many still undocumented); the various linkages between business and biodiversity (which may be an economic input, output, competing resource use, or victim of pollution); insufficient consensus on biodiversity conservation priorities and performance indicators applicable at the enterprise level; weak or missing property rights, liability regimes, and/or incentive measures to penalize biodiversity loss and reward conservation effort; and concerns about potential adverse social impacts. This study presents a synthesis of experience across a range of sectors to develop more sustainable business models for biodiversity conservation, identifies key success factors, and outlines a new approach to building a biodiversity business that combines policy innovation, business development assistance, and financial support.

biologists are confronted with a number of basic questions in their quest to conserve the earth's biological resources. I have distilled these to the following: What are we trying to conserve? Where are the most important places in which to conserve it? How should we go about doing conservation? Who can best carry out conservation? Unfortunately, despite broad agreement on global conservation goals, working on the details of conservation has more often than not resulted in conflict within the conservation movement and divided conservationists to the detriment of what they are trying to accomplish. This conflict has often been to the advantage of those who wish to discredit the conservation movement. It is clear to me that there is a devil in the detail of biodiversity conservation. Answering the first question—What are we trying to conserve?—has probably been the easiest and has engendered the greatest amount of agreement. Biodiversity is the conservation target for governments, U.N. institutions, development agencies, and, of course, conservation organizations. It has become so omnipresent that there is an entire international convention, the Convention on Biological Diversity, devoted to it. Yet even with broad agreement, biodiversity has been defined in many ways, many often vague and difficult to assess (Redford & Richter 1999). It is this vagueness that makes it difficult to determine the where, how, and who of biodiversity conservation. Attempting to identify the most important places in which to conserve biodiversity has led conservation biologists to develop strategic, science-based methodologies for establishing conservation priorities. These methodologies have generally addressed threat and species numbers ( Myers et al. 2000 ) and representation ( Olson & Dinerstein 1998 ). The disturbing side of developing such methodologies has been their marketing. We have seen the production of large picture books supporting megadiversity countries and hotspots, and we have seen posters of representational ecoregions with quotes from learned professionals touting the approach as the most important breakthrough in biodiversity conservation. These are the materials that are used to convince the donor ( and voting ) public and government and institutional funders that the scientific community is lined up in support of a specific method and, by inference, that it is better than the rest. This promotion of one method over another in the race for donor funding has been counterproductive. Luckily, the overlap between different methods of deciding where biodiversity should be conserved is extensive, and a number of organizations have adopted the geographical priorities of others, recognizing that the time and resources required to invent another method of establishing biodiversity conservation priorities would be a waste. The real problems start with the question of how should we go about doing conservation. Today, more than ever, we are seeing a plethora of conservation approaches, ranging from calls for more intensive protection ( Oates 1999; Terborgh et al. 2002 ) to greater community control over biodiversity conservation ( Western & Wright 1994; Hulme & Murphree 2001 ). In most cases these approaches are scientifically sound and have the common goal of conserving biological diversity. So far, so good. The problem is in the race for funding. Conservation organizations have tended to promote and market their own single solutions to biodiversity conservation problems at the expense of other approaches. Such a strategy is dangerous. It is unusual for such approaches to have undergone extensive field-testing. More often than not they are based on a set of theories about how we would like conservation to work, and the assumptions upon which these theories are based are rarely explicitly acknowledged. As we have seen over the years, one can shoot holes in almost any of the approaches tried to date. For example, protected areas are a core component of biodiversity conservation. Yet the method for establishing protected areas is fraught with difficulties. The process usually has involved removing those people living on the newly protected land, often without compensation and sometimes by force. In almost all cases, the result is a park surrounded by people who were excluded from the planning of the area, do not understand its purpose, derive little or no benefit from the money poured into its creation, and hence do not support its existence. As a result, local communities develop a lasting distrust of park authorities, in part because of the glaring lack of attention those authorities, supported by conservationists, have paid to the link between park ecology, the survival of wildlife, and the livelihood of displaced people. Out of the experience with protected areas came the development of integrated conservation and development projects, or ICDPs, through which it was believed that conservation would be more successful if the focus was on the welfare of communities in and around protected areas. Encouraged by the frantic quest for examples of sustainable development, ICDPs exploded in popularity, rapidly advancing from an untested idea attracting seed money to \"best practice\" for biodiversity conservation. The fact that conservation organizations were perhaps not suited to work in the social and economic realms was missed in all the excitement. Successes have been few and far between, and today an expanding barrage of mostly critical literature has fuelled concern among organizations implementing and financing ICDPs. The problems experienced with protected areas and ICDPs have resulted in conservation organizations developing a number of new approaches. These have grown out of the limitations of simple site-based project activities. These new, more complex approaches are attempting to \"vertically integrate\" site-based projects, surrounding land uses, and policy initiatives. A major challenge for these emerging landscape- or ecoregion-scale approaches will be to position other complementary conservation activities operating on a variety of spatial and temporal scales. Although these approaches are in their infancy, it already seems clear that their success will depend on the links between their constituent parts. In the first analysis of its kind, Redford and colleagues show in this issue of Conservation Biology that there is greater overlap between approaches than was perhaps generally believed. This argues for a broad range of biodiversity conservation tools being available and, more important, marketed by all organizations; simple, one-organization solutions will not work. Perhaps most critical, these efforts to conserve biodiversity cannot be made in isolation. They must involve effective partnerships to address the larger-scale problems that defy local solutions. This leads us to the last question: Who has the experience most appropriate to doing the conservation? Traditionally, conservation organizations have been reluctant to collaborate among themselves or with other professions. This go-it-alone mentality has often been the result of the perceived need for different groups to have their own easily identified portfolios of projects that can be marketed to prospective donors. This has resulted in endless claims and counterclaims over conservation approaches that are themselves a sort of territorial battle of knowledge and experience—a way to show the donors who does conservation right, and best. Such ownership has promoted a lack of collaboration and partnership. It has also fostered in organizations an unwillingness to try a range of approaches; they rely instead on those developed in-house and vigorously defend them from any competing method. It is clear, however, that as conservation approaches have become greater in scale and broader in context, conservation organizations do not have all the skills necessary to get the job done. McShane and Newby ( 2003) found that many of the constraints on biodiversity conservation involved issues with which conservationists tended to be inexperienced or uncomfortable. Conservation organizations must work harder at reaching out within their own profession and to other disciplines. Recently, collaboration and the development of partnerships has moved beyond rhetoric. Newly developed partnerships include the World Wildlife Fund ( WWF ) and CARE in East Africa and Conservation International, the Wildlife Conservation Society, and WWF in the Congo Basin. At the policy level, Conservation International and WWF have written the World Bank (with whom they both have a partnership ) expressing concern over proposed changes to the bank's operational policy for forests. By bringing together a number of different conservation organizations to look at many of the existing approaches to conserving biodiversity, Redford et al. ( 2003 ) have taken an important step in promoting such coordination and collaboration. These are all moves in the right direction, but collaboration must be maintained and nurtured. The issues of funding, fundraising, and project ownership must be part of the process. Biodiversity conservation's devil is the competition for donor funding. We all know that successful biodiversity conservation requires money. Unfortunately, in the pursuit of funds, conservation organizations find themselves making claims based on little more than theory. This marketing of conservation approaches has resulted in a dogmatic debate, outwardly over how best to conserve the world's biodiversity, which is a necessary question, but behind the scenes over how to get the funds before someone else does, which is not. Conservation organizations and the conservation biologists that work for them must look closely at themselves. We all know what we want to conserve, and we broadly agree on where we should be doing conservation. We have a number of approaches to help us do the work, and we know that we are not expert at everything that needs to be done. It is time for the conservation community to put organizational competition aside and work together for biodiversity conservation. There are a few good examples beginning, and we must be build on these.","citation":"Thomas O. McShane (2003)","page":"chunk_1_1"}

Forest management practices have led to a reduction in the volume and a change in the composition of coarse woody debris (CWD) in many forest types. This study compared CWD volume and composition in reserves and two types of managed forest in the central boreal zone of Sweden. Ten areas were surveyed, each containing clear-cut, mature managed and old-growth stands, to determine the volume of standing and lying CWD in terms of species composition, decay class and size class. Volumes of CWD on clear-cuts and in mature managed forests were high compared with previous studies. Old-growth forests (72.6 m3 ha−1) contained a greater volume of CWD than mature managed forests (23.3 m3 ha−1) and clear-cuts (13.6 m3 ha−1). Differences were greatest for the larger size classes and intermediate decay stages. Despite stand ages being up to 144 years, CWD volume and composition in managed forests was more similar to clear-cuts than to old-growth forests.

Global Economic Prospects 2007 analyzes the opportunities - and stresses - this will create. While rich and poor countries alike stand to benefit, the integration process will make more acute stresses already apparent today - in income inequality, in labor markets, and in the environment. Over the next 25 years, rapid technological progress, burgeoning trade in goods and services, and integration of financial markets create the opportunity for faster long-term growth. However, some regions, notably Africa, are at risk of being left behind. The coming globalization will also see intensified stresses on the \"global commons\". Addressing global warming, preserving marine fisheries, and containing infectious diseases will require effective multilateral collaboration to ensure that economic growth and poverty reduction proceed without causing irreparable harm to future generations.

Sub‐Saharan Africa continues to face the daunting challenge of alleviating poverty due to slow economic growth. In southern Africa, most countries are adopting policies that promote the integration of biodiversity conservation and rural development to contribute to rural poverty alleviation. Numerous approaches have been undertaken in this endeavour, including Transfrontier Parks (TFPs) and Transfrontier Conservation Areas (TFCAs). This paper discusses some of the limitations of the TFPs. In conclusion I posit that unlike TFPs, which are state controlled and managed, TFCAs, which promote multi‐land use and multi‐stakeholder participation are attainable and have a higher probability of sustaining biodiversity conservation and contributing to the alleviation of rural poverty, if: (i) areas of high biodiversity conservation within communal areas can be identified, zoned and leveraged to biodiversity conservation and managed in partnership between the communities and the private sector; (ii) local communities can secure legal rights to their customary land being devoted to biodiversity conservation and use such pieces of land as collateral in negotiating partnerships with the private sector in developing conservation‐based enterprises; (iii) functional community natural resource governance institutions can be established and empowered to represent their constituencies in securing fair equity from profits made from sustainable use of the conserved biodiversity assets and tourism businesses; (iv) concerted effort can be invested in developing and implementing family planning and fertility reduction strategies that would slow down human population growth to levels that can be sustained by the available natural resources; and (v) if sustainable financing mechanisms can be developed, and the governance of protected areas occurring in the TFCAs can be broadened to include other stakeholders.","citation":"Simon M.

article delineates trajectories of the glocalization of law and maps the changing contours of legal pluralism using empirical material on World Bank financed infrastructure and biodiversity projects in India. The role of international institutions, social movements and NGOs, which challenge the monopoly of the state over the production of law and the definition of the common good, is analysed with reference to conflicts over privatization of natural resources, struggles against forced displacement and loss of livelihood as well as the complaints on behalf of indigenous communities before the World Bank Inspection Panel. It is argued that despite scattered sovereignties in the new architecture of global governance, the state remains a central albeit contested terrain. Its pivotal role in selectively transposing conditionalities, law and policies into the national arena as well as its strategies to avoid accountability are foregrounded against the attempts by civil society actors to use national and international legal platforms to enforce compliance with environmental and human rights standards.","citation":"Shalini Randeria (2003)","page":"chunk_1_1"}

As the world approaches the 30-year anniversary of the Stockholm Conference on the Human Environment and prepares to review progress made in the decade since Dublin and Rio, we are confronted with results that are mostly disappointing. When it comes to addressing the water resources crisis, the 1990s may well be remembered as a decade of debate rather than action. Recent assessments suggest a doubling to almost two-thirds of the world's population experiencing some water stress by 2025 and increased demands to withdraw more water for a new \"green revolution\" for irrigated agriculture. Both of these will accelerate environmental degradation to a new crisis level while the existing degradation that resulted from the first \"green revolution\" still awaits remedial action both in the North as well as in the South. It is now clear that the global water crisis and the global environment crisis are linked and are being exacerbated by unprecedented global pressure resulting from over-consumption, population growth, globalization of economic systems and trade, reduction in development assistance, and failure to enact necessary policy, legal, and institutional reforms. This article makes the case that the traditional sector-by-sector approach to economic development is a key contributor to the two global crises. Lessons of experience are presented on policy, legal, and institutional reforms necessary to address the inter-linked crises through integrated approaches to managing land and water resources and their biological diversity. Water pricing reforms, reductions in damaging subsidies, land tenure reforms, community participation, and institutional reforms are necessary. There is a need to build upon the linkages and synergies among the three Rio conventions (climate, biodiversity, and desertification) in order to create new global driving forces for actions to address the crises holistically in the context of a country's national sustainable development strategy. The Global Environment Facility (GEF) and its implementing agencies stand ready with incremental cost grant financing to assist countries willing to undertake the reforms for integrated basin management of land, water and biological resources as they transition towards sustainable development","citation":"Alfred M.

Besides supplying the growing demand for wood, plantations and agroforestry systems provide environmental services such as carbon sequestration and recovery of biodiversity. Several countries of Central America have recently started incentive programs to encourage plantation and agroforestry development. In Costa Rica, Payment for Environmental Services (PES) provides subsidies to farmers for plantations and agroforestry systems. Funding for these subsidies comes from a special tax on gasoline, and from external sources sought by FONAFIFO (National Fund for Forestry Financing). These plantations and agroforestry systems are established on degraded land by farmers who are often advised by local NGOs (non-governmental organizations) or by research institutions that have practical experience in the region. Gathering information on species selection, plantation silviculture, and environmental services provided by plantations and agroforestry systems is important to the success of these systems. These incentive programs can also serve as a model for starting or modifying similar programs in other countries with comparable ecological and socioeconomic conditions. This paper presents experiences with native species plantations over the past twelve years in Costa Rica. Data on volume, biomass production and recuperation of biodiversity are presented. We recommend the establishment of government incentives for reforestation and agroforestry systems with native Species.","citation":"Florencia Montagnini et al. (2004)","page":"chunk_1_1"}

agricultural research has historically been an example par excellence of open source approach to biological research. Beginning in the 1950s and especially in the 1960s, a looming global food crisis led to the development of a group of international agricultural research centers with a specific mandate to foster international exchange and crop improvement relevant to many countries. This formalization of a global biological commons in genetic resources was implemented through an elaborate system of international nurseries with a breeding hub, free sharing of germplasm, collaboration in information collection, the development of human resources, and an international collaborative network. This paper traces the history of the international wheat program with particular attention to how this truly open source system operated in practice and the impacts that it had on world poverty and hunger. The paper also highlights the challenges of maintaining and evolving such a system over the long term, both in terms of financing, as well the changing 'rules of the game' resulting from international agreements on intellectual property rights and biodiversity. Yet the open source approach is just as relevant today, as witnessed by current crises in food prices and looming crop diseases problem of global significance.","citation":"Derek Byerlee & H. J.

need apes as much as the apes need the forests. They are the gardeners of the forest - keystone species in the ecology of African and Southeast Asian forests, dispersing seeds, creating light gaps and pruning branch-tips whilst feeding. Their habitat comprises two of the planet's three major tropical forest blocks that are essential for global climate regulation. But the economic pressures that are destroying ape habitats are much greater than current available conservation finance. This unique case study from the Kibale national park illustrates how biological research has had diverse consequences for conservation. It examines effects on habitat management, community relations, ecotourism and training. Lessons learned from this project over the last 20 years will inspire researchers and conservationists to work together to promote biodiversity through field projects.","citation":"Richard W.

issues surrounding 'Reduced Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation' (REDD) have become a major component of continuing negotiations under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). This paper aims to address two key requirements of any potential REDD mechanism: first, the generation of measurable, reportable and verifiable (MRV) REDD credits; and secondly, the sustainable and efficient provision of emission reductions under a robust financing regime.To ensure the supply of MRV credits, we advocate the establishment of an 'International Emission Reference Scenario Coordination Centre' (IERSCC). The IERSCC would act as a global clearing house for harmonized data to be used in implementing reference level methodologies. It would be tasked with the collection, reporting and subsequent processing of earth observation, deforestation- and degradation driver information in a globally consistent manner. The IERSCC would also assist, coordinate and supervise the computation of national reference scenarios according to rules negotiated under the UNFCCC. To overcome the threats of \"market flooding\" on the one hand and insufficient economic incentives for REDD on the other hand, we suggest an 'International Investment Reserve' (IIR) as REDD financing framework. In order to distribute the resources of the IIR we propose adopting an auctioning mechanism. Auctioning not only reveals the true emission reduction costs, but might also allow for incentivizing the protection of biodiversity and socio-economic values. The introduced concepts will be vital to ensure robustness, environmental integrity and economic efficiency of the future REDD mechanism.","citation":"Michael Obersteiner et al.

Abstract:Developing countries are facing major challenges to their rural land use, including deforestation, increasing scarcity of tree products, and environmental degradation on fragile agricultural lands. One of the ways they have responded to these problems is by promoting \" agroforestry, \" or on-farm tree establishment and management. Public agencies, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) and international donors have supported agroforestry development efforts and are considering further substantial investments. But agroforestry activities have been poorly documented and project monitoring has been weak or nonexistent or has addressed administrative concerns only. To answer the need for hard data, an analysis of the costs, benefits, and farmer adoption of agroforestry was undertaken. This was the first large-scale study of farm-level profitability of agroforestry in the tropics and involved empirical work for twenty-one projects in Central America and the Caribbean.

of the most important reasons for the degradation of biodiversity, in mountain areas and elsewhere, is that the people who make land use decisions often receive few or no benefits from biodiversity conservation. Understandably, therefore, they generally ignore potential biodiversity benefits when choosing land use practices. The end result is that biodiversity is often lost, as are many other off-site benefits such as the regulation of hydrological flows. Efforts to enhance biodiversity conservation need to take account of the constraints faced by individual land users, who decide what practices to adopt on their land. Over the years, a variety of efforts have been made to boost the profitability of biodiversity-friendly practices for land users, with mixed results. A further approach, which has received increasing attention in recent years, is to provide direct payments for the provision of environmental services such as biodiversity conservation. The simple logic of Payments for Environmental Services (PES) is that compensating land users for the environmental services a given land use provides, makes them more likely to choose that land use rather than another. The Regional Integrated Silvopastoral Ecosystem Management Project, which is being implemented by the World Bank with financing from the Global Environment Facility (GEF), is piloting the use of PES as a means of generating biodiversity conservation and carbon sequestration services in watersheds at three sites in Colombia, Costa Rica, and Nicaragua.","citation":"Stefano Pagiola et al.

their Policy Forum “Direct payments to conserve biodiversity” (29 Nov., p. [1718][1]), P. J. Ferraro and A. Kiss argue for more direct payments to conserve biodiversity instead of indirect interventions that are coupled to social-economic projects at the level of the rural community, because “such initiatives rarely work.” The authors admit that there are many disadvantages to direct payments, e.g., inequitable land tenure, poor legislation, and possible misuse; however, such obstacles would also apply to indirect methods. They state, “the cheapest way to get something you want is to pay for what you want” (p. 1719).\n\nIndeed, indirect social-economic interventions are not cheap and may not lead to clearly quantifiable conservation results. However, cost-efficiency is not the only consideration in conserving biodiversity. Duration is another important criterion. Direct payments are probably very effective in the short term; the authors present many examples. But, when the payment stops, continuation of conservation is uncertain because the external motivation has been taken away, or to put it more simply, “no pay, no care.” The loss of biodiversity is an irreversible process; direct payments may therefore only be successful if they pave the way for durable conservation practices. Otherwise, direct payments may be a waste of money because a long-lasting continuation of costly measures for the protection of collective goods as biodiversity or nature is not guaranteed in a world that is primarily driven by economic rules.\n\nIn addition, direct payments stress a vision of nature where countable, measurable, and monetary aspects dominate. There is nothing wrong with such a quantification of nature if we realize its shortcoming: Monetarization of nature may imply that nonnature alternatives that deliver the same service can be substituted for nature. In contrast, ethical, aesthetic, and spiritual motives for nature conservation ([1][2]) often imply the irreplaceability of nature. It is important to base valuation and conservation of nature on such robust motives that resist temporary, threatening trends. Debate and education are therefore important indirect tools ([2][3]).\n\nWe may conclude that conservation should be rooted in the life and mind of involved people to be successful in the long run. The view of Ferraro and Kiss matters, but we should look at direct payments as part of a wider perspective. For example, direct payment can function as a start-up method for more sustainable, locally embedded approaches or should be applied when direct, short-term intervention is needed because of a threatening catastrophe. Unfortunately, this latter situation seems often to be the case.\n\n1. [↵][4]1. J. A. A. Swart, 2. H. J. van der Windt, 3. J. Keulartz\n , Restor. Ecol. 9, 230 (2001).\n [OpenUrl][5][CrossRef][6][Web of Science][7]\n\n2. [↵][8]1. D. W. Orr\n , Conserv. Biol. 16, 1457 (2002).\n [OpenUrl][9][CrossRef][10]\n\n# Response {#article-title-2}\n\nSwart suggests that direct payments are useful as a stop-gap measure when there is a need to change peoples' behavior radically and urgently but that, on the whole, we should rely on “sustainable, locally embedded approaches” to achieve conservation on a long-term basis. The appeal of self-financing conservation activities, which require outside investment only for a short time and then continue on their own steam to yield conservation and development benefits indefinitely, is obvious. Unfortunately, evidence of their existence is difficult to find. In some cases, the expected demand for the outputs fails to materialize; in other cases, demand becomes so great that it triggers nonsustainable exploitation or attracts competitors who can produce at lower cost by ignoring the conservation objectives. If the enterprises fail, the conservation link disappears (if there was one to begin with). In short, the “no pay, no care” dilemma is very real, but it applies to any conservation intervention. Biodiversity conservation is a public good, and, thus, one way or another, it must be subsidized because individuals will not voluntarily bear its cost on behalf of society at large. We believe that it makes practical and economic sense to subsidize conservation directly rather than indirectly.\n\nSwart argues that direct payments emphasize a vision of nature in which countable, measurable, and monetary aspects of nature dominate and that one should instead choose an approach that emphasizes the ethical, aesthetic, and spiritual motives for conservation. On the contrary, although direct payments may be in cash (or in kind), the motivations of those who provide payments are usually ethical, aesthetic, or spiritual. These motivations have certainly been strengthened by debate and education. We do not doubt that people who deplete biodiversity also have ethical, aesthetic, and spiritual values for nature. Biodiversity continues to be destroyed, however, because these noneconomic values have not been sufficiently robust to overcome economic forces. Debate and education cannot make these forces disappear. It is essential to counterbalance them by making it economically attractive (and feasible) for people to protect biodiversity instead of destroying it.\n\nSwart's argument that the use of payments would make nature a commodity like any other traded good or service misses the point that biodiversity is already a heavily traded commodity. It is an essential input into a variety of production activities such as fishing, logging, hunting, and agriculture. Unfortunately, local users can reap far greater economic rewards from depleting biodiversity than from conserving it. Biodiversity is being depleted for want of a better offer; payments will help rectify this problem.\n\nWe wholeheartedly agree with Swart that “conservation should be rooted in the life and mind of involved people to be successful in the long run.” However, we believe that such rooting is established through tangible incentives, not through wishful thinking that poor people in low-income nations will make substantial sacrifices in the short term for uncertain future rewards or for the benefit of the global community. Although direct payments are no “silver bullet,” they provide tangible incentives that can be flexibly and cost-efficiently linked to the protection of biodiversity in low-income nations. Given the lack of alternatives, we believe that direct payments for biodiversity conservation offer the best and most effective use of limited global conservation funds.\n\n [1]: /lookup/doi/10.1126/science.1078104\n [2]: #ref-1\n [3]: #ref-2\n [4]: #xref-ref-1-1 View reference 1 in text\n [5]: {openurl}?query=rft.jtitle%253DRestor.%2BEcol.%26rft.volume%253D9%26rft.spage%253D230%26rft.atitle%253DRESTOR%2BECOL%26rft_id%253Dinfo%253Adoi%252F10.1046%252Fj.1526-100x.2001.009002230.x%26rft.genre%253Darticle%26rft_val_fmt%253Dinfo%253Aofi%252Ffmt%253Akev%253Amtx%253Ajournal%26ctx_ver%253DZ39.88-2004%26url_ver%253DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%253Dinfo%253Aofi%252Ffmt%253Akev%253Amtx%253Actx\n [6]: /lookup/external-ref?access_num=10.1046/j.1526-100x.2001.009002230.x&link_type=DOI\n [7]: /lookup/external-ref?access_num=000169227600013&link_type=ISI\n [8]: #xref-ref-2-1 View reference 2 in text\n [9]: {openurl}?query=rft.jtitle%253DConserv.%2BBiol.%26rft.volume%253D16%26rft.spage%253D1457%26rft.atitle%253DCONSERV%2BBIOL%26rft_id%253Dinfo%253Adoi%252F10.1046%252Fj.1523-1739.2002.01668.x%26rft.genre%253Darticle%26rft_val_fmt%253Dinfo%253Aofi%252Ffmt%253Akev%253Amtx%253Ajournal%26ctx_ver%253DZ39.88-2004%26url_ver%253DZ39.88-2004%26url_ctx_fmt%253Dinfo%253Aofi%252Ffmt%253Akev%253Amtx%253Actx\n [10]: /lookup/external-ref?access_num=10.1046/j.1523-1739.2002.01668.x&link_type=DOI","citation":"Jac.

The Coral Triangle Initiative (CTI) in south-east Asia offers a new opportunity to address marine conservation in this global biodiversity hotspot. This commentary offers an analysis of the concept of networked marine protected areas (MPAs) which form the cornerstone of this agenda. Attention is drawn to the value of the scientific rationale for implementing such a network, along with the ability for component MPAs to be self-financing and managed in accordance with local environmental conditions and the needs of resident communities. It is concluded that the current model of MPA networks as represented in the CTI needs to build upon existing MPA practices, recognize the varied socioeconomic, political and environmental characteristics of the region and adopt an adaptive approach to MPA implementation if it is to offer genuine prospects for conservation.","citation":"Julian Clifton (2009)","page":"chunk_1_1"}

Caves are arguably the hottest of the biodiversity hotspots as measured by endemism and threat, yet they receive very little attention or appropriate management. Some recent investigations in China have found that up to 90% of the animals collected in caves are new to science, yet environmental assessments for development projects in karst areas rarely if ever give attention to the cave fauna. The lack of light, and the cave‐specific conditions of humidity, air flow and source of energy have resulted in extreme adaptations among the animals living within them. There is no government agency or non‐governmental organization (NGO) on conservation concerned with caves in China or many other countries, and although there are caving expeditions, they concentrate on exploration rather than the cave fauna. Disturbance by limestone quarrying, visitors, tourism infrastructure, and changes in water flow through, or from above, the cave can have devastating effects on the highly adapted and range‐restricted fauna. Some examples of World Bank‐financed development projects which have led to cave conservation are given. Synthesis and applications. The cave biodiversity of China and neighbouring countries is worthy of conservation and there is a huge number of nationally endemic species, most of which are unknown. Destruction or damage to caves can cause entire communities of cave species to become extinct. To address this problem, the disparate, taxon‐limited specialists interested in cave fauna need to reach out to the cave exploration community, the major conservation NGOs, and the state and local conservation agencies. Those charged with the task of conserving biodiversity should give thought to how the current national protected area systems and processes manage – and fail – to address the needs of the cave fauna, and look for the means to effect the necessary changes in management, based on the peculiar ecology of caves.","citation":"Tony Whitten (2009)","page":"chunk_1_1"}

A brief overview is given of nematode taxonomy since its beginnings in the second half of the 19th century. Most of the work concerned α-taxonomy, but in the thirties and subsequently from the sixties several classifications have been proposed. Since the eighties phylogenetic systematics was introduced as the underlying theory. Due to the pioneering work of several famous nematode taxonomists in the first half of the 20th century an increased interest for the discipline arose. Very unfortunately, this interest decreased in more recent times to an alarming extent. The difficulty to correctly identify and to describe the rapidly increasing numbers of taxa has discouraged many young scientists and diverted them toward more appealing disciplines. Taxonomy provides nevertheless the basic knowledge for studies on biodiversity as well as for analyses of ecological and phylogenetic relationships. Molecular techniques have made systematics again exciting; when combined with the more traditional morphological approach, they will lead to new insights. Hopefully, these will arouse the interest of young scientists. Even then the future of nematode taxonomy will depend on the funding opportunities provided by national and international authorities. La systématique des nématodes est brièvement revue depuis ses origines dans la seconde moitié du 19ème siècle. La plupart des travaux sont relatifs l’ α-taxinomie, mais dans les années trente et ensuite dans les années soixante, plusieurs classifications ont été proposées. Depuis les années 80, la systématique phylogénétique a été introduite comme la théorie sous-jacente. Grâce au travail de pionnier de plusieurs taxinomistes célèbres dans la première moitié du 20ème siècle, un intérêt accru est apparu pour la discipline. Très malheureusement, cet intérêt a décru récemment jusqu’à un niveau alarmant. La difficulté d’identifier correctement et de décrire un nombre de taxons augmentant rapidement a découragé de nombreux jeunes scientifiques et les a poussé vers des disciplines plus attirantes. La taxinomie cependant apporte la connaissance de base tant pour des études de biodiversité que pour des études de relations écologiques et phylogénétiques. Les techniques moléculaires ont rendu la systématique à nouveau attractive; lorsqu’elles seront combinées avec l’approche morphologique plus traditionnelle, elles conduiront à de nouveaux développements. Heureusement, elles vont réveiller l’intérêt des jeunes chercheurs. Malgré cela, le futur de la taxinomie des nématodes dépendra des opportunités de financement par les autorités nationales et internationales.","citation":"A. Coomans (2000)","page":"chunk_1_1"}

of improved silvopastoral practices in degraded pasture areas is thought to provide valuable local and global environmental benefits, including biodiversity conservation, However, these practices are insufficiently attractive to individual land users for them to adopt them spontaneously, particularly due to their high initial costs. This paper describes the contract mechanism developed for the Regional Integrated Silvopastoral Ecosystem Management Project, which is being implemented with financing from the Global Environment Facility (GEF). The project is testing the use of the payment-for-service mechanism to encourage the adoption of silvopastoral practices in three countries of Central and South America: Colombia, Costa Rica, and Nicaragua. The project has created a mechanism that pays land users for the global environmental services they are generating, so that the additional income stream makes the proposed practices privately profitable. Designing the mechanism required addressing issues such as (1) measuring the actual amount of environmental services being provided, so that appropriate payments can be made; (2) providing payments in a way that resulted in the desired change in land use; and (3) avoiding the creation of perverse incentives (for example, for land users to cut down existing trees so as to qualify for additional payments for tree planting). Two variants of the proposed payment mechanism are being tested, with participating land users assigned randomly to one or the other. The project also includes extensive monitoring of the effectiveness of each mechanism in stimulating adoption of the proposed measures and of the resulting impact on environmental services and on household welfare. These features, together with the three-country approach, will provide in the coming years a very rich dataset for testing the use of contract mechanisms for biodiversity conservation.","citation":"Stefano Pagiola et al.

approaches to environmental management are all the rage. Claims that market mechanisms can encourage environmental protection and promote greater economic efficiency while saving taxpayers' money are tantalizing. In the forestry sector, policy makers are widely heeding this advice and shrinking command–and–control systems in favour of incentive mechanisms that seek to align private enthusiasm with the public good. In some cases, governments are even promoting the creation of markets where none existed before. In others, markets are evolving of their own accord. In such times of change, it is difficult to stand back and take stock. Yet, it is during such times that guidance is most needed. In the rush to introduce market–based solutions to environmental problems, a particular concern is how markets are impacting on the poor.In this paper an effort is made to draw on a recent review of markets for four forest environmental services (biodiversity conservation, carbon sequestration, watershed protection and landscape beauty) to draw out preliminary insights into how markets are performing with respect to their impacts on the poor. The evidence suggests a need for caution. While the potential benefits are significant, the poor face an uphill battle in realizing them. Key constraints facing the poor include a lack of property rights over forest resources and their environmental services; inadequate skills and education; poor market information; lack of market contacts; inadequate communication infrastructure; inappropriate contract design; and lack of access to financial resources. To tackle these, four potential ways forward are highlighted:(1) assign property rights to forest assets and their related environmental services in ways that respect customary arrangements and poor people's tenure;(2) strengthen capacity for market participation, e.g. through training and education;(3) invest in the provision of market information, advice and, essentially, a contact point for buyers and sellers, perhaps through the establishment of a 'market support centre'; and(4) improve access to finance so that poor individuals can make necessary up–front investments in market participation.","citation":"Natasha Landell-Mills (2002)","page":"chunk_1_1"}

As a result, the pace of new connections to electricity, water, and sanitation services increased by more than 40 percent. Moreover, households in traditionally excluded sectors—the poor, rural, and indigenous populations—were twice as likely to be the beneficiaries of a new infrastructure connection than they had been prior to the Peace Accords. The teledensity index increased by a factor of five from 4.2 in 1997 to 19.7 in 2001, largely because of the growth in cellular telephones, which now outnumber fixed lines. The number of public telephones in rural areas increased by 80 percent since the Peace Accords, so that 80 percent of rural households are now within six kilometers from a public telephone. Although real electricity tariffs increased by 60–80 percent following the reform, residential consumers have been shielded by a \"social tariff\" policy that has kept charges at pre-reform levels. This policy, which costs US$50 million a year, does little to benefit poor households. The reason is that 60 percent of poor households are not connected to the electricity network, and those that are consume modest amounts of electricity and hence capture only 10 percent of the total value of the subsidy. In contrast, poor households without access to electricity pay about US$11 a kilowatt-hour (or 80 times the electricity tariff) to light their homes with candles and wick lamps. The resources used to finance the \"social tariff\" would therefore be better used in further accelerating the pace of new connections for currently underserved households. This paper—a product of the Finance Private Sector, and Infrastructure Unit, Latin America and the Caribbean Region—is part of a larger effort in the region to understand the social impacts of infrastructure reform.

I reviewed some of the financial mechanisms for biodiversity conservation activities in Brazil. There is a heavy dependence on the public sector, but macroeconomic policies aimed at reducing government spending have resulted in reduced budgets dedicated to public conservation measures. The financial constraints for environmental protection have also increased because of a reduction in foreign aid. Positive signs for the immediate future, however, come from new initiatives that create economic instruments to finance conservation. The most important initiatives include conservation criteria for tax redistribution; environmental compensation; water charges; royalties for electricity, petroleum, and natural gas; tradable obligations for forest reserves; and voluntary measures on the part of the business sector. Resources created from these initiatives have different origins and are managed by different public agencies according to varying laws and policies, so their efficient implementation will require that the institutions involved in biodiversity conservation in Brazil establish a minimum set of common priorities and objectives.","citation":"Carlos Eduardo Frickmann Young (2005)","page":"chunk_1_1"}

volume assesses how various institutional, policy and managerial options can enhance nature tourism's contribution to the triple bottom line. There are win-win outcomes but also trade offs between various policy objectives including: economic growth; poverty reduction; conservation finance/biodiversity conservation. This collaborative report highlights the complementarities and the trade-offs in promoting and managing sustainable nature tourism development and conservation. Nature tourism is important for many developing countries, including South Africa. If wisely managed, nature tourism offers valuable opportunities for generating revenues for development and for conservation. The recommendations are fairly specific to the Ezemvelo KwaZulu Natal Wildlife area. By combining various options into an integrated package to achieve economic development, equity and conservation, such a balanced approach provides pro-poor tourism opportunities for local communities, by reinvesting the proceeds in on-the-ground work in the reserves and in the community. It requires collaboration with private game reserves to drop fences and could contribute to a successful transformation of wildlife management to a nature tourism economy.","citation":"Bruce Aylward & E.

The World Summit on Sustainable Development (WSSD) was held in Johannesburg in 2002 to review progress since the Rio conference in 1992, and to agree a new global deal on sustainable development. Unlike its predecessor, it was primarily concerned with implementation rather than with new treaties and targets, although a number of new targets were agreed, for example one on sanitation. Failure to agree a target on renewable energy was regarded as a major disappointment of the conference. While relatively modest in its achievements, and with difficulties in achieving consensus in key areas such as energy, trade, finance and globalisation, WSSD nevertheless succeeded in placing sustainable development back on the political agenda, giving new impetus, in particular to the environment and development needs of Africa, with a strong focus on local issues like household energy, water and sanitation. Health was singled out as one of five priority areas, along with water, energy, agriculture and biodiversity, and was devoted a separate chapter in the resulting Plan of Implementation, which highlighted a range of environmental health issues as well as issues relating to health services, communicable and non-communicable diseases. A number of new partnerships were formed at WSSD, including the Healthy Environments for Children Alliance (HECA) launched by WHO, which will form an important platform for implementation. The Commission on Sustainable Development has been designated main responsibility for monitoring and follow up, with its programme of work reorganised to focus on thematic clusters of issues. From the perspective of health, WSSD must be seen as a reaffirmation of the central place of health on the sustainable development agenda, and in the broader context of a process which began in Rio and was given added impetus with the Monterrey Financing for Development conference and the World Trade Organisation meeting held in Doha. Translating policies into action at all levels- global to local – remains the single biggest challenge in the years that lie ahead.","citation":"Yasmin von Schirnding (2005)","page":"chunk_1_1"}

exurban, and rural development in the United States consumes nearly 1 million hectares of land per year and is a leading threat to biodiversity. In response to this threat, conservation development has been advanced as a way to combine land development and land conservation while providing functional protection for natural resources. Yet, although conservation development techniques have been in use for decades, there have been few critical evaluations of their conservation effectiveness. We addressed this deficiency by assessing the conservation outcomes of one type of conservation development project: conservation and limited development projects (CLDPs). Conducted by land trusts, landowners, and developers, CLDPs use revenue from limited development to finance the protection of land and natural resources. We compared a sample of 10 CLDPs from the eastern United States with their respective baseline scenarios (conventional development) and with a sample of conservation subdivisions--a different conservation development technique characterized by higher-density development. To measure conservation success, we created an evaluation method containing eight indicators that quantify project impacts to terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems at the site and in the surrounding landscape. The CLDPs protected and managed threatened natural resources including rare species and ecological communities. In terms of conservation benefits, the CLDPs significantly outperformed their respective baseline scenarios and the conservation subdivisions. These results imply that CLDPs can offer a low-impact alternative to conventional development and a low-cost method for protecting land when conventional conservation techniques are too expensive. In addition, our evaluation method demonstrates how planners and developers can incorporate appropriate ecological considerations when designing, reviewing, and evaluating conservation development projects.","citation":"Jeffrey C.

Many endangered species depend on certain types of agricultural or other forms of human land use. To conserve such species, schemes are set up in which land users receive payments for voluntarily managing their land in a biodiversity‐enhancing manner. We developed a model‐based framework for designing cost‐effective payment schemes that generate spatiotemporal habitat heterogeneity to maximize the survival of multiple species under budget constraints. The framework integrates ecological and economic knowledge and consists of the derivation of an ecological benefit function and a budget function that are then combined to determine the cost‐effective degree of spatiotemporal habitat heterogeneity. The ecological benefit function considers the timing of conservation measures, the induced habitat dynamics, and different degrees of substitutability among species. The budget function considers that the conservation agency may lack information about land users’ individual conservation costs and personal attitudes and that land users can choose among different conservation measures. We applied the framework to a case study of grassland management, where the survival of three endangered species protected by the EU Habitats Directive depends on different types of land use. The lack of information available to the agency and the choice options of land users reduced the amount of conservation that can be financed with a given budget. Neglecting such findings may lead to an overestimation of the benefits of conservation programs.","citation":"Martin Drechsler et al. (2007)","page":"chunk_1_1"}

Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD) in developing countries is a new financial mechanism that is being proposed for the post-2012 climate change regime under the auspices of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).Successful agreement on a future REDD mechanism would represent a substantial and unprecedented development in the creation of an international mechanism to help internalise the carbon-related ecosystem services from forests and could make a significant contribution to addressing the global climate change challenge.Forests also play a key role in the provision of biodiversity, as well as other non-carbon ecosystem services.The Bali Action Plan recognises that action to support REDD \"can promote co-benefits and complement the aims and objectives of other relevant international conventions and agreements\".A notable example is that of the Convention on Biological Diversity.This report examines how biodiversity co-benefits in REDD can be enhanced, both at the design and implementation level.It discusses potential biodiversity implications of different REDD design options that have been put forward in the international climate change negotiations and proceeds by examining how the creation of additional biodiversity-specific incentives could be used to complement a REDD mechanism, so as to target biodiversity benefits directly.Key design elements of a REDD mechanism that need to be agreed upon, and are likely to have implications for biodiversity, include: the scope of the mechanism; financing; the establishment of baselines/reference levels; and permanence issues, amongst others.For example, a market-based approach to REDD financing (rather than a fund-based approach) is likely to generate substantially larger volumes of financing (by directly engaging the private sector), which would enable more REDD activities, greater forest areas being conserved, and hence larger biodiversity co-benefits.Overall, a well-designed REDD mechanism is likely to deliver substantial biodiversity co-benefits since avoided deforestation and degradation implies a decline in habitat destruction and thus in biodiversity loss.However, some of the international REDD design elements may pose potential risks to biodiversity, for example via afforestation and reforestation activities that resulted in mono-plantations, and appropriate safeguards may be needed.At the implementation level, further efforts can help ensure that biodiversity co-benefits can be mainstreamed into REDD activities in an efficient and informed manner.For example:  Some international financing would be well-invested in economically evaluating and geographically mapping biodiversity and ecosystem services benefits as this can provide an important input to national REDD planning and implementation.An improved database on national biodiversity will increase the likelihood of using this information to achieve and maximise REDD co-benefits. If a REDD mechanism is successful in avoiding deforestation and degradation, it could free up financial biodiversity resources from areas where

A conservation scheme for local poultry breeds from the Veneto region (Italy), the Co.Va. (Conservazione e Valorizzazione di Razze Avicole Locali Venete - Conservation and valorisation of local poultry genetic resources of Veneto region) project began in 2000 with finance provided by the Veneto Region. This project involved four organic farms located in different areas (mountain, hill and plain) in the region. The local chicken breeds included in the project were the Robusta Maculata, Robusta Lionata, Ermellinata di Rovigo, Pépoi and Padovana; the local duck breeds were the Germana Veneta and Mignon; the local turkey breeds were the Bronzato Comune and Ermellinato di Rovigo; and the local guinea fowl breed was the Camosciata. All breeds are dual-purpose breeds and are utilized for meat and egg production. The Department of Animal Science of the University of Padova planned a marker-assisted conservation scheme based on the maintenance and multiplication of these breeds within their production system (in situ conservation scheme). The objectives of the farmers involved in this project were to use these genotypes to generate typical regional products for local markets, to support the development of economically marginal areas through the revaluation of local breeds and to allow the preservation of animal biodiversity.","citation":"Massimo De Marchi et al.

PES require a secure long-term source of financing to work effectively. Obtaining payments directly for biodiversity conservation is difficult, however. In most cases, water users are the most likely source, either directly or indirectly. Thus the potential for PES to help conserve biodiversity depends, in a large measure, on the degree to which areas of interest for conservation of water services overlap with areas of interest for conservation of biodiversity. This paper examines the extent of such an overlap in the case of highland Guatemala. The results show that this potential varies substantially within the country, with some biodiversity conservation priority areas having very good potential for receiving payments, and others little or none. Overall, about a quarter of all biodiversity conservation priority areas have potential for receiving payments. Thus PES are far from being a silver bullet for biodiversity conservation, but they can make a meaningful contribution to this objective.","citation":"Stefano Pagiola et al.

carbon market recently appeared as a new way to finance conservation programs in Madagascar. Based on an analysis of a pioneer carbon sequestration project co-financed by the Biocarbon Fund of the World Bank, I contend in this article that this new approach will fail to contribute to the protection of Malagasy biodiversity. A first argument is that carbon projects will inherit rural development practices and discourses that did not lead to successful agricultural intensification until now. For this reason, they will fail to compensate farmers for the land lost by reforestation. A second argument is that the potential profits generated by carbon sale provide a supplementary motive for the appropriation of resources by the state and other actors, to the detriment of local communities. I conclude that in order to make carbon sequestration an effective tool for conservation, it is necessary to implement successful agricultural development activities, to guarantee the use rights of local communities, and to channel to them the most significant part of the carbon profits. This last strategy should not be regarded as a payment for environmental service. Rather, it is the just granting of usufruct to communities that have legitimate use rights on reforested land.","citation":"Jacques Pollini (2009)","page":"chunk_1_1"}

conservation outcomes are closely related to the rules and institutions governing resource use. Creating local incentives for conservation through more secure resource tenure is central to conservation outcomes on private and communal lands, where the preponderance of biodiversity occurs. Conservation efforts in sub-Saharan Africa are therefore centrally concerned with governance dynamics and institutional reform processes, such as the decentralization of property rights, and how best to achieve such reforms. Traditional mechanisms for financing conservation efforts in Africa rely heavily on funds channeled through multilateral and bilateral aid agencies. The history of development aid highlights a range of constraints these aid agencies face in terms of working toward more effective resource governance arrangements and promoting reforms. Government aid agencies possess incentives for promoting large-scale and short-term projects that maximize expenditure volumes and tend to define issues in technical rather than political terms. The history of development aid suggests that these and other characteristics of aid agencies impedes their ability to influence governance reform processes and that aid funding may discourage the adoption of reforms. Greater emphasis in African conservation financing needs to be placed on flexible, small-scale investments aligned to local interests and constituencies that prioritize innovation, learning, and experimentation. Additionally, more research is required that explores the linkages between conservation funding, donor decision-making processes, and governance reforms.","citation":"Fred Nelson (2009)","page":"chunk_1_1"}

has been touted as a source of finance for biodiversity conservation. Recent work has suggested that the bioprospecting value of the \"marginal unit\" of genetic resources is likely to be vanishingly small, creating essentially no conservation incentive. This result is shown to flow specifically from a stylized description of the research process as one of brute-force testing, unaided by an organizing scientific framework. Neither the biological literature nor the behavior of industry actors lends clear support to the contention that natural products prospecting proceeds on the basis of randomized search. Scientific models channel research effort towards leads for which the expected productivity of discoveries is highest. Leads of unusual promise then command information rents, associated with their role in reducing the costs of search. When genetic materials are abundant, information rents are virtually unaffected by increases in the profitability of product discovery, and decline as technology improvements lower search costs. Numerical simulation results suggest that, under plausible conditions, the bioprospecting value of certain genetic resources could be large enough to support market-based conservation of biodiversity. The results call into question the conclusions of earlier analyses that had argued that biodiversity prospecting offers no hope as a meaningful source of finance for biodiversity conservation.","citation":"Gordon C.

came out as a global issue from the mid 1980s, under the pressure of converging forces: the threatening increase in species extinction and the changes in the theory as well as in the practice of nature conservation, but also the expansion of genetic engineering and the intrusion of industrial interests into areas from which they had been hitherto excluded. These elements have participated in the development of utilitarian perceptions of nature, reduced to a set of resources thanks to new technologies that have made its extensive economic exploitation possible. The Convention on Biological Diversity, adopted in 1992 during the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro, is in line with this approach (UNEP 1992). Indeed, the Convention rests on the notion of sustainable use of biological resources (first article), that is, an exploitation that meets the criteria of efficiency and equity and is meant to finance conservation but also to foster development in countries of the South and to benefit pharmaceutical and agricultural industries. The Convention presents the definition of adequate property rights to biological resources and related knowledge as an essential prerequisite for the institution of the sustainable use—hence of the conservation—of biodiversity. This analysis comes to adhere implicitly to the conventional view of biodiversity erosion as a consequence of the appropriation failure that prevailed prior to the adoption of the Convention. Transnational corporations then had free access to indigenous resources—including knowledge—and after screening they could patent parts of these resources or their applications, depriving their former holders of their traditional use rights, as attested by the examples of neem in India or yellow bean in Mexico, both patented by American","citation":"Valérie Boisvert & Armelle Caron (2002)","page":"chunk_1_1"}

the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity has been called one of the greatest challenges. At the heart of this challenge lies the low financial and political value which is often assigned to biodiversity and the resulting lack of financial mechanisms for conservation and sustainable use. This report provides an overview of existing and experimental financing mechanisms that can be used to encourage the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity. To help to better understand these mechanisms, it proposes a taxonomy that divides the mechanisms into three categories: 1) Those that protect biodiversity as a public good; 2) Those that require correcting so-called \"negative externalities\" that hamper biodiversity conservation; 3) Those that can be used to support biodiversity-based businesses. The report ends with recommendations on how the Bank can support financing mechanisms that promote the conservation of biodiversity and its sustainable use.","citation":"Ricardo Bayón et al.

1992 Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) challenged signatory countries to seek and encourage new financial resources, including private-sector resources, to implement the objectives of the Convention. During the past decade, pioneering businesses have succeeded at making money while conserving and sustainably using biodiversity. What lessons have we learned? How can we speed up the adoption of biodiversity-friendly business activities? Where and how can additional private investment for biodiversity conservation and sustainable use be found? To answer these questions, this article reviews why biodiversity conservation needs private-sector finance. It defines the beneficial links between business and biodiversity; presents the business rationale for financing conservation and sustainable use; identifies who is currently investing in these businesses; and outlines the conditions necessary to attract considerably more amounts of private-sector financing for biodiversity conservation and sustainable use.","citation":"Michael C.

parks in developing countries are home to the planet's most undervalued natural assets. Positive experience with public-private partnerships in nature conservation in Africa shows that they can improve service through professional management and marketing, reduce the need for public subsidies, and mobilize capital for investment in park infrastructure and biodiversity. The best choice of structure for such partnerships depends mainly on the capacity of the incumbent public park agency. Within a national system of protected areas a diversified funding strategy makes it possible to focus public resources on the protected areas that cannot be self-financing but are critical to achieving the system's biodiversity objectives.","citation":"Nico Saporiti (2006)","page":"chunk_1_1"}

methods often are focused on preserving the biodiversity of a particular landscape or ecosystem. Scientists frequently employ species richness as an indicator of biodiversity. However, species richness data are problematic when attempts are made to enumerate microfungi, particularly those from the soil. Many soil fungi fail to sporulate, making identification difficult. Other means of assessing the importance of fungi to ecosystem preservation must be developed. Otherwise, microfungi might be overlooked in discussions of ecosystem management and conservation issues. Herein, we have described a procedure (Soil FungiLog) and analytical techniques that will let investigators examine the functional role that soil fungi play in providing structure and stability to ecosystems. Ecosystem function in many cases might be more important than species diversity in gaining an understanding of ecosystem dynamics. Functional attributes are critical for maintaining ecosystem structure and stability. The preservation of the functions associated with the extant biota, particularly from soil microbes, might be just as important as species diversity in the conservation of ecosystems and biodiversity. The Soil FungiLog procedure was used to assess functional diversity of soil fungi in a Georgia forest disturbed by human activity and along an elevational gradient in the Chihuahuan Desert. Sites within each location were separated on the basis of fungal carbon substrate utilization profiles. These profiles were analyzed to provide information regarding the functional diversity of soil fungal assemblages at each site. The effects of disturbance and elevation were evaluated with respect to soil fungal functional diversity.KeywordsBiologdiscriminant function analysisfunctional diversityFungiLogsoil fungi The authors gratefully acknowledge Richard E.
