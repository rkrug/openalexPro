Bay of Ranobe, in southwest Madagascar, once noted for its high biodiversity and fish abundance, is under increasing pressure from overfishing, pollution, sedimentation and tourism. The declining health of the coral reef is reflected in fishery productivity and survey data on biological diversity. Sustainable conservation requires the engagement of all interested parties and the integration of their needs into resource management. The British NGO ReefDoctor has adopted this approach in establishing the first community-protected site in the Bay of Ranobe, the Massif des Roses. This is a large coral patch with a high percentage of live coral cover (38 % ) and important fish diversity compared to other sites surveyed in the lagoon. Since 25 May 2007 it has been legally recognised as a community managed marine reserve under temporary protection where fishing is banned. Tourists must now pay an entry fee to visit the site, with the proceeds contributing to the funding of community projects. In conjunction with the protection of this site, ReefDoctor has worked with local people, regional and local government, tour operators and hotels, and conservation organisations to set up ‘FIMIHARA’, an association representative of local people responsible for the management of this site and the development of sustainable conservation initiatives in the Bay of Ranobe. This paper explains the approach taken by ReefDoctor, by setting up and working with FIMIHARA, to protect the Massif des Roses site and develop other conservation initiatives and community projects in the Bay of Ranobe. La baie de Ranobe, au sud - ouest de Madagascar, autrefois remarquable pour sa biodiversité et l’abondance de la pêche, est de plus en plus menacée par la surpêche, la sédimentation, la pollution et le tourisme. Le déclin de l’état de santé du récif corallien se reflète dans la diminution de la productivité des pêcheries et dans les suivis de la biodiversité marine. La situation est à présent critique car les ressources marines associées au récif assurent la subsistance des populations côtières vivant le long de la baie. Nous considérons ici qu’une protection pérenne nécessite un engagement concret de toutes les parties prenantes - en particulier des communautés locales - et que leurs besoins soient intégrés dans la gestion des ressources. L’ONG ReefDoctor a mis en oeuvre cette approche lors de la création de la première réserve marine dans la baie de Ranobe gérée par la communauté locale, le Massif des Roses. Cette réserve est constituée d’un grand massif de corail largement couvert de coraux et abritant une importante diversité de poissons par rapport au reste du lagon. Depuis le 25 mai 2007, ce site est légalement reconnu comme réserve marine communautaire avec un statut de protection temporaire ; la pêche et les pratiques destructrices associées au tourisme y sont interdites. De plus, les touristes doivent désormais payer un droit d’entrée pour visiter le site, qui contribue au financement de projets communautaires. En parallèle avec la protection du site, ReefDoctor a travaillé avec les communautés locales, les responsables nationaux et régionaux du gouvernement, les opérateurs touristiques et diverses organisations de protection de la nature pour créer l’association FIMIHARA, représentative de la population locale. Cette association, qui a un statut légal depuis le 11 avril 2007, a pour but d’améliorer la qualité de vie de ceux qui vivent le long de la baie de Ranobe et de mettre en oeuvre des projets de conservation des ressources marines et terrestres dans la région de la baie de Ranobe. La création de la réserve marine communautaire du Massif des Roses a rapidement connu le succès qui s’est traduit par la vente de plus d’un millier de tickets, mais l’association FIMIHARA doit encore faire face à de nombreux défis. L’objectif principal de l’association à long terme est de développer son indépendance par rapport à l’ONG ReefDoctor et sa capacité à gérer indépendamment les ressources marines de la baie de Ranobe dont les communautés locales dépendent pour leur survie.","citation":"RD Stein - Rostaing et al.

Notes An earlier version of this article appeared as a background paper for the World Bank's World Development Report 2003. Additional material draws on case studies produced under the author's direction at the RARE Center for Tropical Conservation, with research assistance from Cristin Tighe and Mary Ann Kutny. The author wishes to thank Russell Dalton for timely access to data from the GEOS survey. 2For the most comprehensive cross-national survey, see R.E. Dunlap, G.H. Gallup & A.M. Gallup, Health of the Planet: Results of a 1992 International Environmental Opinion Survey of Citizens in 24 Nations, (1993). Analyses of these and other public opinion data are provided in R.E. Dunlap & A.G. Mertig, Global Concern for the Environment: Is Affluence a Prerequisite?, 51(4) J. Social Issues 121-137 (1995); S.R. Brechin & W. Kempton, Global Environmentalism: A Challenge to the Postmaterialism Thesis?, 75(2) Social Sci. Q. 245-269 (1994); Q. Kidd & A.-R. Lee Postmaterial Values and the Environment: A Critique and Reappraisal, 78(1) Social Sci. Q. 1-15 (1997). 3A political analysis of the impressive accomplishments of Costa Rica and Bolivia in the realm of biodiversity policy is provided in P.F. Steinberg, Environmental Leadership in Developing Countries: Transnational Relations and Biodiversity Policy in Costa Rica & Bolivia. (2001). 4The poor record of protected areas management in the tropics is reviewed in C. van Schaik, J. Terborgh, and B. Dugelby, The Silent Crisis: The State of Rain Forest Nature Preserves, in Last Stand—Protected Areas and the Defense of Tropical Biodiversity 64-89 (R. Kramer, C. van Schaik, & J. Johnson, eds. 1997). Although some researchers of the political ecology school (see for example S.R. Brechin et al. (eds.), Contested Nature: Promoting International Biodiversity with Social Justice in the Twenty-first Century (2003)) take issue with van Schaik and colleagues about the underlying causes of these problems—placing greater emphasis on social justice rather than improved enforcement—the two sides agree that current strategies are far from adequate. The rampant trade in illegally harvested tropical timber is described in Environmental Investigation Agency & Telapak, Profiting from Plunder: How Malaysia Smuggles Endangered Wood (2004). The challenge of implementing pollution reduction strategies in developing countries has been the subject of extensive research by the World Bank's New Ideas in Pollution Regulation Program. See for example World Bank, Greening Industry—New Roles for Communities, Markets, and Governments, A World Bank Policy Research Report. (2000) 5 See for example R.O. Keohane, Analyzing the Effectiveness of International Environmental Institutions, in Institutions for Environmental Aid: Pitfalls and Promise 3-27 (R.O. Keohane & M.A. Levy, eds. 1996). 6The synergistic concept of civic conservation presented here is consistent with usage of the term civic environmentalism in C.Sirianni & L. Friedland, Civic Innovation in America: Community Empowerment, Public Policy, and the Movement for Civic Renewal (2001). It is important to distinguish the present usage from that of DeWitt, who describes civil society alternatives to government regulation. See J. DeWitt, Civic Environmentalism: Alternatives to Regulation in States and Communities. (1994). 7P. Wapner, Environmental Activism and Civic World Politics. (1996); T. Princen & M. Finger, Environmental NGOs in world politics: Linking the local and the global. (1994). 8 See for example M. Edwards & D. Hulme (eds.), Beyond the Magic Bullet: NGO Performance & Accountability in the Post-Cold War World. (1996). 9There is a considerable but seldom acknowledged congruence between the thinking of populists and libertarians on this point. Compare for example J.C. Scott, Seeing like a State: How Certain Schemes to Improve the Human Condition Have Failed (1998); M. Friedman, Capitalism & Freedom (1962). 10 See P. Hirsch (ed.), Seeing the Forest for the Trees: Environment and Environmentalism in Thailand (1996). See also S.M. Darlington, Rethinking Buddhism and Development: The Emergence of Environmentalist Monks in Thailand, 7 J.

Migdal, Strong Societies and Weak States: State Society Relations & State Capabilities in the Third World (1987). The political ecology literature has amply documented zero-sum interactions that impede the prospects for collaboration in conservation policy. See for example N.L.

environmental sustainability is essential to achieving all the Millennium Development Goals. Long-term solutions to problems of drinking-water shortages, hunger, poverty, gender inequality, emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases, maternal and childhood health, extreme local weather and global climate changes, and conflicts over natural resources need systematic strategies to achieve environmental sustainability. For this reason, the UN Millennium Project Task Force on Environmental Sustainability has concluded that protection of the environment is an essential prerequisite and component of human health and wellbeing.1UN Millennium Project Environment and human well-being: a practical strategy.Report of the Task Force on Environmental Sustainability. Earthscan, London2005Google Scholar Economic development and good health are not at odds with environmental sustainability: they depend on it. One important dimension of environmental sustainability is the need to maintain ecosystem services critical to the human population. These services include providing food, shelter, and construction materials; regulating the quantity and quality of fresh water; limiting soil erosion and regenerating nutrients; controlling pests and alien invasive species; providing pollination; buffering human, wild plant, and animal populations from interspecific transfer and spread of diseases; and stabilising local weather conditions and sequestering greenhouse gases to contain climate change. A second and equally important dimension of environmental sustainability is the need to control water pollution and air pollution, including the emission of greenhouse gases that drive climate change. These so-called brown issues can have a severe effect on human health and ecosystem function. Natural systems worldwide are being degraded at unprecedented rates. Standing forests, particularly in the tropics and subtropics, are disappearing at a rate of over 10–15 million hectares per year. If current trends persist, southeast Asia, for example, will probably lose up to 75% of its original forest and 42% of its original wildlife species by 2100.2Sodhi NS Koh LP Brook BW Ng PKL Southeast Asian biodiversity: an impending disaster.Trends Ecology Evolution. 2004; 19: 654-660Summary Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1131) Google Scholar The highly fragmented forests that remain will be greatly diminished in their ability to provide the goods and services outlined above. Deforestation can further increase the risk of natural disasters, as evidenced by the deadly landslides in the Philippines in November, 2004, after steep slopes above several towns were denuded. Degradation of the marine environment is also extreme. Coral reefs are severely damaged by dynamite and cyanide fishing, together with soil and untreated chemical runoff from agriculture, industry, and domestic households. Moreover, rising ocean temperatures resulting from climate change are projected to further increase coral bleaching.3IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) Climate change 2001: impacts, adaptation, and vulnerability, contribution of Working Group II to the Third Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.

As human beings derive ever more food from the sea yet persist in destroying the nurseries that supply that harvest, local and global fisheries have begun to collapse.5Pauly D Christensen VV Dalsgaard J Froese R Torres Jr, F Fishing down marine food webs.Science. 1998; 279: 860-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (3510) Google Scholar Since two-thirds of the world's population depends on fish as their main source of protein,6Burke L Kura Y Kassem K Revenga C Spalding M McAllister D Pilot analysis of global ecosystems: coastal ecosystems.

One focus of the task force was the health consequences of environmental degradation, which is a contributing factor to the emergence, re-emergence, and accelerated dispersal of zoonotic and vector-borne diseases. In particular, the zoonotic transfer of a disease from another avian or mammalian species to human beings has become increasingly common, accounting for 75% of the emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases recorded in the past decade.7Taylor LH Latham SM Woolhouse ME Risk factors for human disease emergence.Philos Trans R Soc Lond B Biol Sci. 2001; 356: 983-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (1842) Google Scholar Prominent examples of zoonotic diseases are severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Lyme disease, which have affected thousands of people and resulted in economic losses of tens of billions of US dollars.8Daszak P Cunningham A Emerging infectious diseases: a key role for conservation medicine.in: Aguirre A Ostfeld R Tabor G House D Pearl M Conservation medicine: ecological health in practice.

Notwithstanding their impact and the attention they garner, the ecology of many zoonotic diseases remains understudied and poorly understood. For example, whereas civet cats found in markets in China have been identified as harbouring SARS, the species that serves as the reservoir for the SARS virus has not yet been determined. However, scientists have linked the reduction of mammalian biodiversity with increased likelihood of human cases of Lyme disease,10LoGiudice K Ostfeld RS Schmidt KA Keesing F The ecology of infectious disease: effects of host diversity and community composition on Lyme disease risk.Proc Natl Acad Sci USA. 2003; 100: 567-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (831) Google Scholar but responses to the disease are still focused on individual treatment rather than better land use and wildlife-management policies that might stem the spread of Lyme and possibly other new pathogens. Land-use change, along with global warming, has further led to rises in insect-borne diseases, such as malaria, dengue, and filariasis in many parts of the world.11Walsh JF Molyneux DH Birley MH Deforestation: effects on vector-borne disease.Parasitology. 1993; 106: S55-S75Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar, 12Manga L Toto JC Carnevale P Malaria vectors and transmission in an area deforested for a new international airport in southern Cameroon.Ann Soc Belg Med Trop. 1995; 75: 129-132Google Scholar, 13Vasconcelos PF Travassos da Rosa AP Rodrigues SG Travassos da Rosa ES Degallier N Travassos da Rosa JF Inadequate management of natural ecosystem in the Brazilian Amazon region results in the emergence and reemergence of arboviruses.Cad Saude Publica. 2001; 17: 155-164Crossref PubMed Google Scholar When trees are cut down and rutted logging roads are left behind, puddles and sunshine create new habitats for malaria-transmitting mosquitoes.

Polluted sources of drinking and bathing water cause widespread and severe health problems, and are especially lethal to children. Acute respiratory infections linked to indoor air pollution kill 1·6 million people per year, mostly children and women.18Bruce N Perez-Padilla R Albalak R Indoor air pollution in developing countries: a major environmental and public health challenge.Bull World Health Organ. 2000; 78: 1078-1092PubMed Google Scholar This figure represents an enormous loss of human and economic potential in developing countries. Furthermore, urban air pollution causes the premature death of an additional estimated 0·5–1·0 million people in developing countries per year.19Kojima M Lovei M Urban air quality management. Coordinating transport, environment, and energy policies in developing countries.World Bank technical paper No 508. World Bank, Washington, DC2001Google Scholar How then can the degradation of the environment be contained and environmental sustainability be achieved? A first challenge to overcome is the fact that, although scientifically sound, the concept of environmental sustainability does not translate immediately into operational objectives. To this end, the task force recommends that as part of their national-level processes for the Millennium Development Goals, countries should set their own long-term objectives, such as maintaining a specific share of natural forests, lowering acid deposition below a certain threshold, or achieving a target level of nutrient load in critical freshwater ecosystems. Since virtually all human activities have an effect on the environment, strategies to achieve these objectives and reverse the loss of environmental resources need to be broad-based and include every sector of society. Doing so requires major structural changes nationally, regionally, and globally that must be coupled with specific investments in improved environmental management. The task force has identified practical interventions to improve the management of environmental resources in at least six key areas: soils and land-based production systems, forests, marine ecosystems and global fisheries, freshwater ecosystems, climate change, and pollution. These tested interventions can be delivered at scale provided that countries have access to substantially strengthened human resources and increased financial resources. Least-developed countries and many other poor countries will be likely to require additional external finance to improve environmental management However, technical interventions, no matter how good, will not be sufficient unless they are accompanied by structural changes to effectively integrate the environment into all development plans and sector policies. First, among these changes is the need to strengthen public institutions responsible for environmental policymaking and to build up environmental expertise in other government groups, such as ministries for health or infrastructure, to better appraise environmental consequences of all sector strategies. Second, countries need to correct market failures and remove distortions that exacerbate environmental degradation. Thus, wherever possible, countries should phase out damaging subsidies that overcapitalise industries such as farming, fishing, and forestry, and that promote inefficiencies, overextraction, and environmental damage. Third, we underscore the importance of improving our knowledge about the environment—including the crucially under-researched environment–health links—and to make this information effectively available to senior decision-makers through science-advice mechanisms. Moreover, environmental education and training must be integrated into the curricula of primary and secondary schools worldwide to improve the public's understanding of the environment.20Pearl M Buchori D Padua S Human and institutional capacity building through education and training.Background paper commissioned for the UN Millennium Project Task Force on Environmental Sustainability. UN Development Programme, New York2004Google Scholar Finally, efficiency gains through advanced science and technologies directed at environmental challenges can slow the rise in demand for certain ecosystem services. Several proven approaches exist to promote science and technology that can be harnessed for the environment. The knowledge and tools exist to guide us toward an environmentally sustainable future. However, the lack of success in stemming environmental degradation over the past decades has shown that the challenge lies in applying them. Successful implementation is key and will hinge on the active participation of the private and public sectors, as well as an informed and engaged citizenry. The Millennium Development Goals provide an important operational framework for addressing environmental sustainability in concert with other development priorities. During 2005, the international community should honour its commitment to support all countries in scaling-up direct investments in environmental management and implementing the structural changes that underpin them. This represents the only rational way forward. Conflict of interest statement We declare that we have no conflict of interest.

wide-ranging contents of this special issue on of water have stimulated a number of thoughts on my part as a former practitioner in this area. My views are grouped below around seven topics: concept of water itself; levels at which can be handled; Integrated Water Resource Management (IWRM) as a leading paradigm of governance; water rights; accountability and voice; transparency and corruption; and options of financing at national and scales. I conclude by anticipating some themes from forthcoming third edition of World Water Development Report (WWDR-3). (1) Sound management of water is a function of a complex interaction of numerous factors, including demographics, economic development and trade, social and cultural processes, consumption patterns, technology, and climate. Moreover, many of these factors are changing rapidly, adding further complexity. This situation rules out any possibility for universal templates or one-size-fits-all solutions to water management. That said, when properly planned and implemented, instruments can affect water's drivers and uses to improve efficiency, equity, and sustainability. Unfortunately, however, most important decisions impacting water today are often being made in domains outside that of water, without water being considered as a priority topic. For example, decisions about health, food, and energy on a sector basis or about poverty reduction and sustainable development in broader frameworks can have a major impact on water resources. The Concept of Governance: Is Elastic Stretched Too Far? In area of water more specifically, has been defined as the range of political, social, economic and administrative systems that are in place to develop and manage water resources, and delivery of water services, at different levels of society. (2) In this vein, Global Water Partnership (GWP) ToolBox on Integrated Water Resource Management contains almost fifty components. More concisely, Claudia Pahl-Wostl, Joyeeta Gupta, and Daniel Petry have described in this special issue as how water resources can be managed best. Global adds an extra layer to a matrix that is already quite complex. Is there a risk that governance is becoming such a broad concept, covering anything that isn't pipes and pumps, that it may lose its resonance? Should we first unpack still rather inchoate concept of at other levels before promoting it in arena? In any case, it is important to distinguish aspects of that are truly global from those that are actually international or merely widespread. Many water issues arise between specific countries in a trans-boundary or regional context. This makes water different from truly issues such as climate change or biodiversity issues, in which carbon emissions and species losses affect whole of humanity. We need to be clear which water issues are veritably global. Two issues of water clearly must be handled at a level. The first is process to make more rational system that allocates water management responsibilities among institutions (see Pahl-Wostl, Gupta, and Petry, this issue). Until recently, two dozen agencies and programs of United Nations claimed responsibility for various aspects of water. Now UN Water exists as a central coordinating body, providing an opportunity to acquire critical mass on water issues while preserving concerns of other agencies. A second aspect of water requiring attention is of trade through World Trade Organization (WTO). The concepts of virtual water and water footprints are starting to have traction for both national and policymakers. An article in this issue (see Liao, de Fraiture, and Giordano) demonstrates that expansion of China's exports following its entry into WTO may aggravate its already serious water constraints. …","citation":"Olcay Ünver (2008)","page":"chunk_3_1"}

data resources are becoming increasingly important for ecologists. However, compared with fields such as molecular biology and physical environmental science, there are few resources containing raw ecological data that can be used for further research. Reasons for this include the greater heterogeneity of most ecological data compared with, say, nucleic acid sequences, or remote-sensing data, and the fact that many data are collected by individual research laboratories rather than by a community effort. Examples of web-based ecological data resources are the Long-term Ecological Research (LTER) catalogue of the data collected across the US network of environmental monitoring sites (http://www.lternet.edu/), and the Global Population Dynamics Database (GPDD) (NERC Centre for Population Biology at Imperial College, 1999) which makes available 5000 time-series of species population densities, each over 10 years duration. The Ecological Society of America established the Ecological Archives (Peet 1998) as a depositary for electronic information. Fields that overlap with ecology are perhaps richer in web-based data resources: Treebase (http://www.treebase.org/treebase/) is a database of phylogenies, while an increasing number of taxonomic catalogues are now web-based. Much biodiversity information including distributional and ecological data are being collected digitally, or are being digitized, and the goal of the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) is to provide a seamless portal for access to this distributed resource. The purpose of this article is to describe a web-based resource for the UK's long-term individual-based time-series (LITS) data. In the next section we explain what we mean by LITS data, introduce the LITS project, and then describe the web resource. In the concluding part we discuss several issues the project raises that may influence future moves to make more ecological information available on the web. We define LITS data as a type of time-series data where information is recorded not only on the numbers of a species at a particular site but also ancillary information on the state of individuals. This information may be time-invariant attributes like sex or genotype; single events like date of birth or death; or features that change with time such as weight, spatial location, clutch or litter size, and parasite load. LITS data often also includes information about links between individuals, for example parentage, identity of mates, or position within a dominance hierarchy. The biological data may be associated with information about the physical environment, for example local climatic and weather fluctuations or spatial patterns in topography or soil factors. The precise distinction between what are, and what are not, LITS data is of course somewhat fuzzy, and in practice we take long-term to be more than 5 years or generations, and have concentrated on datasets with the richest individual-based data. The efficient storage, preservation and dissemination of LITS data are important for two reasons. First, by its nature LITS data take a long time to collect and, especially in studies that record many attributes of different individuals, they require many man-hours and much expense. LITS data are often organizationally complex, and their interpretation requires detailed documentation which, if lost, may render the time-series worthless or of reduced value. Second, LITS data are often extremely valuable for exploring ecological and evolutionary hypotheses. We pick three examples illustrating this importance from the many that we could quote. Moyes et al. (2006) used LITS data from a population of red deer (Cervus elaphus) to examine survival costs of reproduction. They report that current reproduction reduces the survival probability over the coming year, especially in young and old individuals. In contrast, an increase in cumulative reproductive effort, defined as the proportion of years in which a female has bred since sexual maturity, increases the probability of survival. This positive effect on survival of cumulative reproduction is generated by differences in individual fitness and such effects can only be identified with data on complete life histories (i.e. reproductive histories and mortality information) from a large number of individual females. A second example comes from the Galapagos. The study of Darwin's finches (Geospiza sp.) on the small island of Daphne Major by Peter and Rosemary Grant and colleagues provides an example of one of the most important LITS datasets ever collected. Among other projects, the Grant's used this dataset to show how ecological and evolutionary dynamics of one species, G. fortis, was influenced by the colonization of Daphne Major by a competitor species, G. magnirostris. The arrival of G. magnirostris caused a decline in population density of G. fortis as interspecific competition for food increased, which also generated a response to selection of its beak shape (Grant & Grant 2006). These ecological and evolutionary consequences required detailed information on food availability, population size, individual phenotypic characteristics and mother-offspring links collected over three decades. Without these data such insights could not have been achieved. Our final example shows how the analysis of multigenerational pedigrees from wild populations has provided insights into the consequences of human actions on ecological and evolutionary change. Once again, this understanding could not have been realized without LITS data on individual mortality, morphometric measurements, and a pedigree also built on individual-level genetic data. The bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis) population from Ram Mountain, Alberta, Canada, has been studied at the individual level for three decades. Trophy hunting of large-horned males occurs, leading to selection against large horns. This selection has led to an evolutionary response for smaller horned animals, as they survive longer and now achieve many matings because of the absence of large-horned competitors (Coltman et al. 2003). The United Kingdom has a long history of collecting LITS data, and this has involved ecologists ranging from large-scale multi-institutional teams such as the Soay sheep (Ovis aries) project (Clutton-Brock & Pemberton 2004) through to individuals, such as Tim Healing's work on the Skomer Island bank vole (Clethrionomys glareolus) (Healing et al. 1983). LITS data are a significant national resource for understanding the local response to environmental change, as well as a major contribution of the UK to international science. The aim of the LITS project was three-fold. 1. To survey the LITS datasets concerning terrestrial vertebrates that had been collected in the UK, and by UK-based researchers conducting work overseas. 2. To assess their archival status – whether they were in digital or non-digital form, stored securely, and sufficiently documented. 3. To produce a web resource that would include a catalogue of datasets with associated metadata (defined below) and, where requested, complete datasets. Many of the UK LITS datasets (see Appendix S1 in Supplementary material) are amongst the most well-known ecological studies. To survey the UK LITS corpus we contacted the holders of the datasets known to us with a provisional list and asked for information about any we had overlooked. We believe the list of 71 datasets we identified is reasonably comprehensive but on the website we request information about new projects and any we have overlooked. The second aim of the project was to assess the archival status of the different datasets, and any threats to their continued availability. Risk of loss is difficult to assess quantitatively, but we used criteria such as the current research status of the data owner (active, retired or changed career, deceased, respectively, suggesting increasing risks), the number of recent analyses using the dataset (more recent activity indicating less risk), and the method of data storage (relational databases, spreadsheets, paper files, field notebooks, respectively, correlated with increasing risk). Based on this, datasets were classified as low, medium or high risk. The distribution of risk amongst the 71 datasets indicated that although most of the UKs holdings were at low or medium risk of loss (58% and 22%, respectively), approximately 20% were categorized as being at high risk. Note, although we have informed data owners about our assessment of the archival status of their datasets we are aware that this may be sensitive information and it is not provided on the website. Within the LITS project we had funds for data rescue and used the risk assessment to prioritize how this was spent. Information that provides contextual value to data and assists users in its accurate interpretation is termed metadata. Metadata are diverse and may not only describe things that have been measured or recorded but also document the way in which data are stored, relationships amongst the data, manipulations that have been performed on them, as well as stewardship information. For the LITS catalogue we requested summary metadata (Table 1) from data owners. An advantage of collecting this information in a common format is that it facilitates searching and the comparison of different data resources. Where actual datasets have been mounted on the website more specific information about each data field and their relationships are provided. The outcome of the LITS project is available at http://www.imperial.ac.uk/litsproject/and consists of a catalogue of LITS datasets with their associated metadata. The data depository is an implementation of the Metacat metadata catalogue system (Jones et al. 2001) developed by a consortium of computer scientists, biologists and environmental scientists (Jones et al. 2001). This system is a flexible database specifically designed for metadata storage, query, and access as part of a distributed network of ecological research databases. It can store a diverse range of metadata and data and has a simple user interface allowing flexible search and query. The database uses ecological metadata language (Jones et al. 2001) to store the data. EML is the emerging standard for describing ecological data and is a derivative of extensible mark-up language (XML: Bray, Paoli & Sperberg-McQueen 2000). Currently, two full datasets have been mounted on the website and a third is being made ready. The first is a 15-year dataset of populations of kestrels (Falco tinnunculus) in England and Scotland (Village 1990). The study includes information on the breeding success, diet, sightings, distribution and morphometrics of approximately 1000 marked birds. The second dataset is on a population of rook (Corvus frugilegus) (Patterson, Dunnet & Goodbody 1988) monitored for 11 years. This dataset holds information on sightings, breeding success, morphometrics, and mortality of almost 7000 birds. The last dataset is a 28-year study of a population of sparrowhawk (Accipiter nisus) (Newton & Rothery 1997) and holds data on breeding success and survival for 829 individuals. Additionally, data on eggshell thickness and pesticide residue are included. Unrestricted access has been granted by the data owners to the kestrel and rook datasets while the sparrowhawk data are embargoed until 2009 to allow the data owner to complete some analyses. The data owner can allow restricted access, no access, or password-restricted access. Different parts of the dataset can be accorded different access levels. The three datasets so far have been constructed in Microsoft Access because of its widespread availability, though any format can be used. We hope that further full datasets will be added to the website in time. The website is currently maintained by the NERC Centre for Population Biology, and will ultimately be transferred to the NERC Centre for Ecology and Hydrology designated data centre. During the project we had many discussions with data owners and other ecologists about what constitutes fair use of LITS-type data. Responses varied from the argument that data collected or part-collected using public funds should be immediately available to anyone for analysis (as is sequencing data for example), to the position that access should be completely at the discretion of the data owner indefinitely. We, and many people we consulted, believe that LITS data are different from sequence data and that any fair-use policy should take this into account. The key difference is the length of time required to collect LITS data, and the difficulty and expense of maintaining long-term field studies. Many of the studies catalogued on our website represent a sizeable fraction of the career of the owners, and are responsible for the majority of their published output. It seems to us fair that they maintain control over access rights to their data whilst still professionally active. But more importantly, we are also concerned that insisting on immediate data release would be a significant deterrent to individuals contemplating starting or continuing LITS projects, to the enormous detriment of ecological science. LITS data are typically collected by individuals, laboratories or small consortia of laboratories, often supported by individual grants, sometimes providing their own funds to bridge gaps in support. Thus, funding bodies often only contribute a fraction of the costs involved with the project. This type of data collection is different from other ecological projects such as distribution mapping involving large networks of volunteer recorders coordinated by organizations with core funding where the argument for immediate data release seems far stronger. Based on our consultation we thus put forward for further discussion a suggested fair-use policy for LITS data collected using public funding. While a long-term LITS project is active (data still being collected) the owner should be allowed to determine who has access to the data. The research funder should have the right to ascertain that the data are being stored in a sustainable way with appropriate metadata and documentation, including requesting that an embargoed copy of the database is held at a designated data depositary. This right should be coupled with the provision of adequate funding to cover the costs of data organization (database construction, data entry, etc.) and storage. At the termination of a project the owner retains exclusive rights for a further period of time (this could be a flat period, for example 5 years, or a fraction of the length of the time series, e.g. one-fifth the length in years). All leaders of LITS projects should be encouraged as best practice to collaborate with other groups with complementary skills, and in particular to make data available to groups who want to conduct different types of analyses to those planned by the data collectors. Separate from this, we would expect journals to insist that data used to derive and support results in a publication should be available for the analysis to be repeated, but that this would not need to include the entire study database. While it seems self-evident that providing internet resources cataloguing ecological data is beneficial, they require financing to establish, and support to maintain them. Money spent on database construction and on the provision and maintenance of internet sites is money not spent on original research. We would defend the investment in a LITS database and website on the grounds of the special importance of this type of data, as well as the UK's particular strength in this type of research. But we also wonder whether the very much larger sums of money devoted to some web-based biodiversity projects will repay their capital outlay in terms of the pure and applied science they will enable. We suggest that a discussion is needed within the ecological community about the best ways to invest a limited budget in different eco-informatic projects. The LITS project was funded by the UK's Natural Environment Research Council and dealt only with data owned or collected by UK-based researchers. It is clearly desirable that projects such as LITS should be international, and that different data catalogues should not develop independently in different regions, or that if they do they use compatible data structures and communicate with each other. It is partly for this reason that we used the EML protocols developed for ecological data by the National Centre for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis (NCEAS) in the United States to describe our datasets. We suggest that debate is needed about how best to co-ordinate web-based ecological resources. One model is that a diverse range of initiatives should be encouraged and that different web sites and resources are informally linked by higher level co-ordinating sites, much as GBIF is planning for biodiversity data. A second model is that different countries should take the lead in providing portals for different types of data. Much as the first option seems democratic and non-bureaucratic, our experience with LITS tells us that without significant investment it will be hard to build high quality ecological resources, and that an international division of labour may be the most efficient way to provide the field with web-based support. We thank the researchers who contributed both data and metadata to our databases and Ian Stevenson (Sunadal Data Solutions) for constructing the Microsoft Access databases. We are indebted to the team behind the Metacat database system and in particular Jing Tao and Matt Jones for assistance in building our website.

environment, climate change and the management of natural resources have been taking centre stage with policy-makers and governments in Southeast Asia. It is now recognized that environmental degradation cannot continue unabated over the long term. It is already affecting countries, their economies and communities. Economic and social well-being will depend on how well environmental resources are managed. Concern for the environment was well documented in the Third ASEAN State of the Environment Report 2006: Towards an Environmentally Sustainable Community (SOE 2006). (1) In this report, ASEAN leaders stressed that the resources used to fuel economic growth have to be utilized in a sustainable manner, in order to ensure that prosperity in the region will be durable. ASEAN leaders have also acknowledged that sustainable development, with a dynamic and mutually supportive balance between economic growth, social equity and environmental integrity are to be the guiding principle to establish the ASEAN Community. One way to achieve this balance would be by reconciling economic-environmental trade-offs within the social setting in public policy making. Due consideration must be paid to protecting the environment and its natural resources by ensuring that resources are used in a way that benefits society as a whole, not just private interests. To do this, we need an accurate assessment of the value of environmental goods and services to society. ASEAN faces enormous challenges. Besides ongoing efforts at economic integration and political cooperation, and the high poverty incidence in Cambodia, Lao PDR, Myanmar, the Philippines and Vietnam, (2) there is a need to redress environmental problems like air and noise pollution, sewage disposal and management, traffic congestion, land degradation and deforestation, the depletion of natural resources and biodiversity, damage to marine and coastal ecosystems, depletion of the ozone layer and excessive emissions of greenhouse gases. Managing environmental resources is not easy. Markets normally do a good job of dealing with scarcity--as things become scarcer, their prices increase, people consume less of them and producers invest more in producing them. However, this does not happen when environmental goods become scarce, because few of them are bought or sold in markets. Many are also subject to misguided government policies that encourage environmental destruction by, for example, subsidizing energy consumption, over-fishing and deforestation. Environmental economics can help us to recognize the economic cost and causes of environmental depletion and so help us to react quickly--by strengthening property rights (either private or community-based), applying corrective taxes and so on. Economics can also help us design environmental laws that incorporate workable economic incentives and that, therefore, have a good chance of affecting behaviour. Conversely, environmental economics can reveal the full environmental costs of human activity. By assessing such costs and incorporating them into the prices of goods, we can use market forces to bring about environmental protection: If we all had to pay the full environmental cost of our activities, we would soon learn to conserve resources and to consume in less damaging ways. The papers in this special issue deal in varying degrees the need to price environmental resources. They also address some of the issues identified in the SOE 2006. Specifically, they use economic analysis to examine issues surrounding climate change, environmental degradation and the depletion of natural resources. The authors have been given a free hand to approach these issues from a quantitative or qualitative perspective, and on any aspect of the environment, provided they focus on ASEAN as a region or on ASEAN member countries. These papers report the findings of a series of research projects financed by the Economy and Environment Program for Southeast Asia (EEPSEA). …","citation":"D.W.

water availability per capita in more and more countries is the result of bad management over the past centuries. The 'world water crisis', however, is not inevitable. The concept of Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM) has been promoted over the last ten years as a possible way of reversing such a trend. One of its most fervent promoters is the Global Water Partnership, according to which is a process which promotes the co-ordinated development and management of water, land and related resources, in order to maximize the resultant economic and social welfare in an equitable manner without compromising the sustainability of vital (GWP, 2000: 22). A number of authors are critical of an appropriation of the IWRM concept by the Global Water Partnership devoid of its historical evolution over more than 70 years (Biswas, 2005; Mollard and Vargas, 2005a). As a result of this omission, these authors question the applicability and usefulness of the concept and call for assessing the effectiveness of IWRM implementation. The difficulties of practical IWRM implementation are manifold and include issues of scale, as well as institutional, political, and social constraints to sectoral and environmental integration (Tortajada, 2005; Duda and El-Ashry, 2000; Mitchell, 1990), that can be more or less specific to developing countries (Thioubou, 2002). The 1992 Mexican Water Law, amended in 2004, explicitly refers to IWRM as a national objective. As a result, there has been fairly extensive research on the implementation of IWRM in Mexico at the national level. This study assesses the implementation of IWRM efforts in the municipality of El Grullo (Jalisco), to identify the local and necessary conditions to enhance these. We first recall the innovative aspects of the IWRM concept, as compared to more traditional water management. Ambitious, integrated water resources management is a holistic approach that includes both the natural system (water and its diverse components –surface water/groundwater, quantity/quality– but also all other environmental resources such as land, forests and biodiversity in general) and the human system, including all the different uses (domestic, agricultural, industrial, etc.) (Mitchell, 1990). Integrated water management is an indicator of what Gleick (2000) qualifies as a change in paradigm between the 20th century –where infrastructure development enabled to better exploit resources, perceived as unlimited– and the 21st century, where finite resources are to be managed in order to maintain ecological integrity. Integrated water resources management is necessary to realise this 'blue revolution' (Calder, 2005). It requires, on the one hand, a participative and negotiation-oriented institutional framework and, on the other hand, water pricing tools, so as to balance demand and supply (Meublat, 2001). At the level of a municipality, implementing IWRM efforts translates, on the one hand, in ensuring good quality municipal water and sanitation services without impacting surrounding ecosystems and, on the other hand, participating –with other municipalities and institutions– in coordination activities at the level of the basin or sub-basin (Smits and Butterworth, 2006). Seven months of fieldwork over a three-year period enabled to realise a number of interviews, both with households in the El Grullo municipality (in four urban neighbourhoods and three villages) and with key informants (the local authorities of El Grullo and five neighbour municipalities, members of the Ayuquila-Armeria Watershed Commission and researchers from the partner institution IMECBIO). These interviews were complemented by direct observation as well as secondary sources of information. Our results show that in spite of being well endowed in water resources, the municipality of El Grullo does not manage to provide good quality potable water services. Water distribution is irregular and forces households to resort to appropriate social practices (e.g. use of various storage methods and alternative water sources). The inequity of the variable water service quality is reinforced by a fixed water fee system, in the absence of meters. Further, the lack of any wastewater treatment station impacts riparian villages and aquatic ecosystems located downstream from the wastewater discharge. Efforts are currently underway to address these issues: the municipality wishes to have water meters installed, and is also negotiating a concession with a private company for a constructed wetland to treat municipal wastewaters. At the regional level, the Ayuquila-Armeria Watershed Commission, which was established in 1998, is criticised for the poor effective participation it generates and its lack of means and concrete results. Created in reaction to finance local priorities, the Inter-municipal initiative of the lower Ayuquila watershed, a negotiation platform that convenes ten municipalities, is in comparison relatively successful. Developed through a ten year trust-building process by the researchers from the University of Guadalajara and the directorship of the Sierra de Manantlan Biosphere Reserve, it has enabled the Ayuquila River to regain its original state, as well as set up a series of measures to protect the environment (e.g. the establishment of fire brigades and solid waste separation and recycling programmes). The Ayuquila-Armeria Watershed Commission wishes, in turn, to replicate this model throughout the whole watershed. Although the management plan is still to be designed at the basin scale, these inter-municipal initiatives are indeed judged more flexible and better adapted to IWRM implementation. These results show that in order for the El Grullo municipality to enhance its efforts in terms of IWRM, important changes must take place. More specifically, decentralisation must be reinforced, at the level of both the municipal water board and the Ayuquila-Armeria Watershed Commission. First, the potable water tariffs should be set independently by the municipal water board, on the basis of its operating costs –and not on that of political calculations, as is actually the case by the Jalisco State Congress. This would contribute to put an end to the vicious circle entailed by the municipal board's insufficient financial capacity (i.e. lack of staff, limited infrastructure maintenance, heterogeneous water services, lack of meters, non-payment of fees, etc.), along with other factors at stake (like encouraging a culture of payment). The Ayuquila-Armeria Watershed Commission should also benefit from more freedom and means, in order to increase its credibility among the municipalities its territorial borders encompass. The effective transcription of the 2004 reform of the Water Law, which seems to point in that direction, is awaited by all those interested in this issue. This thesis thus confirms previous analyses of problems surrounding IWRM implementation in Mexico (Mollard and Vargas, 2005b; Tortajada, 2005; Garcia, 2004; Centro del Tercer Mundo para el Manejo del Agua, 2003; Martinez et al., 2002b). It also highlights the importance of finding country-specific ways for ensuring effective IWRM implementation. In particular, this may mean considering other scales than that of river basins.","citation":"Cherryl André de la Porte (2007)","page":"chunk_3_1"}

‘consumer society’ has become a ‘consumer oligopoly’ in Britain as the big four supermarkets, Tesco, Asda, Sainsbury, and Morrison have between them captured a 75% share of the grocery market. This has been achieved through globalisation, the attainment of large economies of scale, and major deployment of buying power. Total annual profits of the ‘big four’ UK supermarkets now stand at £3 billion, and several millions of this is spent on charitable causes and other CSR activities such as promoting sustainable development. However the spectacular growth of the supermarkets over the past fifty years has not been to the benefit of all. Some consumers have seen their access to healthy food curtailed as local shops have closed, and the quality of their diet has fallen; this is often referred to as the ‘food deserts’ phenomenon. The spatial scale of ‘food deserts’, the coping strategies employed by those affected by such ‘deserts’, and the solutions proposed to alleviate food access problems, are profoundly local in character, typically operating over distances of less than two kilometres. This paper suggests that a re‐focussing of the CSR activities of supermarkets towards the local scale can not only boost the social image of the supermarkets in fields where their impact is seen as negative, but can also be profitable for these corporations. Further benefits of a more local perspective include environmental advantages such as the maintenance of biodiversity and support for farmers whose incomes may be in decline. In tandem with a global commercial outlook, supermarkets have engaged with government at a national level to further their business interests. Simultaneously, governmental power within Britain has also moved from the local to the national level. In contrast, many organisations representing disadvantaged groups call for a localised, ‘bottom‐up’, approach. Britain's current centralised ‘top‐down’ approach to governance may be driven by financial pressures or ideological considerations, but this has nevertheless alienated some voters from government. This shift has prompted a certain disengagement with political processes for some individuals, and a shift towards ‘direct action’ tactics which may be damaging to commercial activities. It is argued here that a realignment of the supermarket's engagement with politics from the national to the local level is possible, financed by the resources the supermarkets currently devote to CSR activities. This re‐localisation of supermarket political activity would in fact pay dividends for the ‘big four’ retailers, because by helping to re‐build the legitimacy of national government it would create a more stable environment for business within the UK.","citation":"Hillary J.

R. DeSombre, Global Environmental Institutions (New York: Routledge, 2006). James Gustave Speth and Peter M. Haas, Global Environmental Governance (Washington, DC: Island Press, 2006). Pamela S. Chasek, David L. Downie, and Janet Welsh Brown, Global Environmental Politics, 4th ed. (Boulder: Westview Press, 2006). Richard E. Saunier and Richard A. Meganck, Dictionary and Introduction to Global Environmental Governance (London: Earthscan, 2007). Global environmental governance has emerged as a hot topic in scholarly circles. The manifest inadequacy of international policy cooperation in response to transboundary pollution problems and the need for better management of shared natural resources has led to a flurry of academic writing. Scholars in environmental studies, political science, international relations, and law are now critically analyzing the structure and effectiveness of the international environmental regime and efforts to address change, declining fisheries, deforestation, loss of biodiversity, the spread of toxic chemicals, and other issues. These problems have also captured attention in the public arena. Al Gore won the Nobel Peace Prize for his efforts to focus the public on the climate crisis. His book An Inconvenient Truth and related movie have won numerous awards. Adding to this arc of interest, a number of scholarly books that seek to illuminate the institutions, legal structures, and politics that shape global-scale environmental policymaking have been released over the past several years. The logic of collective action in the international environmental arena is clear. Absent cooperation, the spillover of pollution from one country onto its neighbors or into the shared space of the global commons, as well as the over-exploitation of shared natural resources, promise not just environmental degradation but also economic inefficiency, political instability, and diminished social welfare. Ecological interdependence, expanded economic inter-linkages, and tensions at the trade-environment interface have also made environmental cooperation an important element in the process of establishing the terms of engagement for international commerce. (1) The world community's failure to stem the buildup of greenhouse gas emissions in the atmosphere and resulting fears that the world is suffering the effects of change--global warming, sea level rise, increased intensity of windstorms, changed rainfall patterns, and other problems--add urgency to the quest for a better-functioning international environmental regime. All of the books surveyed in the following paragraphs find negative trend lines with regard to environmental cooperation, with the exception of efforts to phase out chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and other chemicals that destroy the ozone layer. Understanding which international environmental efforts are effective--and why--thus takes on a degree of urgency among issues of global policymaking. Unfortunately, these recent books, while beginning to explore the contours of this important question, do too little to help us understand how to move forward and build a more effective international environmental regime. Nevertheless, the works reviewed provide an important starting point for this critical inquiry. Elizabeth DeSombre's Global Environmental Institutions offers a thorough tour of the existing structure of environment-related international organizations. As part of the Global Institutions Series, edited by Thomas Weiss and Rorden Wilkinson, the book provides a useful history of the UN Environment Programme (UNEP), although some of the details of her analysis have been disputed. (2) DeSombre illuminates the governance, financing, and scientific efforts of UNEP and also reviews the Earth Summits, (3) which have helped structure the international community's thinking about environmental challenges over the past forty years. …","citation":"Daniel C.

present: Sunny Power (President), Mary Power (President-Elect), Norm Christensen (Past-President), Laura Huenneke (VP for Public Affairs), Meg Lowman (VP for Education and Human Resources), Bill Parton (VP for Finance), David Inouye (Secretary), Josh Schimel (Member-at-Large), Emily Stanley (Member-at-Large), Ann Kinzig (Member-at-Large). Rob Jackson (VP for Science) arrives at lunch. Staff present: Katherine McCarter (Executive Director), Cliff Duke (Director of Science), Elizabeth Biggs (Director of Finance), Sue Silver (Editor), Teresa Mourad (Director of Education), Nadine Lymn (Director of Public Affairs), Ramona Crawford (Development), David Baldwin (Publications). Tuesday, 18 November 2007. Meeting is called to order, 9:05 am The Governing Board unanimously adopted the proposed agenda. The minutes from 2, 3, and 8 August 2008 were unanimously adopted. “I made it through the first three months of presidency!” During Board orientation yesterday, there was discussion about one issue President Power would like to pursue: understanding the demographics of our membership, which has implications for attendance at the Annual Meeting (e.g., many people only come to one, and don't return), fund raising, etc. There will be an effort (led by Public Affairs) to share information with the new Obama administration about what the ESA considers to be priorities for actions related to ecological issues. David Baldwin points out that the ESA doesn't have an official policy on privacy of personal information (such as the database of membership information). INTECOL has declined the ESA's bid to serve as secretariat. The British Ecological Society and ESA are combining their archives in JSTOR so that members of either society will have access to both sets of journals. The agreement with CAPES, a Brazilian consortium, for distributing ESA journals is close to completion. Membership has dropped a little (9971), as expected with the lower attendance at the Milwaukee Annual Meeting, but library subscriptions are essentially unchanged. Of the total membership, 17% is from outside the USA. Development: Ramona hopes to increase the percentage of members who contribute to the Society (6.4% now). A mailing has been sent to ~250 potential SEEDS donors. The Development Committee membership will be updated soon. Ramona will ask Board members to help screen potential donors from the Consultative Group on Biodiversity. Frontiers is getting more papers, more proposals for special issues (only two a year), and more letters (which as of next year will be put online, as there is no longer enough room in the journal). As of December, issues to U.S. addresses will not have a plastic mailing envelope (they are required for international addresses). Science: The biofuels conference and workshop are still having active outcomes, including publications. Public Affairs Office: Opening plenary speaker for the 2009 meeting has been chosen: Sandra Postel (Global Water Policy Project). Many issues have been brought to the PAO (e.g., Asian oyster introduction to the Chesapeake Bay). ESA is joining several other societies for a January congressional briefing on the science of climate change. PAO has helped with policy training for other organizations, and Nadine will join an AIBS colleague to help train young faculty at the University of New Mexico this winter. ESA will collaborate with NEON to lead a field trip for congressional staffers to the Smithsonian's Conservation and Research Center (near Front Royal, Virginia, and outside the 35-mile radius within which some activities for congressional staff are restricted). Publications: Society journals are doing well in terms of submissions, time to publication, and the new Web site, but there is a growing backlog of papers awaiting publication (editors were asked to help by increasing the rejection rate). Education: The workshop about NEON sponsored by NSF for faculty education (development workshop on continental-scale ecology for faculty from undergraduate institutions) was very successful. (Liz Blood from NSF was very pleased.) ESA has begun collaborating with a group focusing on ocean science education. There are now 50 SEEDS chapters, and the program is growing, but there is only about one year of Mellon funding left. It would be nice to have more follow-up with SEEDS graduates to facilitate their entry into relevant employment. 1. First Quarter Financials (McCarter) 2. Investment Update (Parton) Our investment portfolio has lost $162,000 since the beginning of the year (a 13% reduction in our portfolio). The portfolio is 60% equity, 40% bonds. Chair Pat Flebbe of the Professional Ethics and Appeals Committee joined the meeting by speaker phone and gave a brief summary of the history of the complaint filed by an ESA member concerning a paper published in an ESA journal. The Board greatly appreciates the efforts of the Committee in investigating this case and making recommendations, and President Power will contact the parties involved to communicate the sense of the Board about this issue. Christensen was asked by the Board to suggest names for a committee that would help to plan events related to the Society's centennial celebration in 2015. Existing committees will also play significant roles, including the Historical Records Committee, Future Meetings Committee, Program Committee, the Publications Committee, and the Governing Board. Older ESA members who have observed a significant part of the Society's history might be appropriate members of the new committee. We should ask all the ESA committees to think about how they might be involved in the celebration, including both celebrating the history and looking toward the future. Ideas are proposed such as: reviving the Ecological Classics column in the Bulletin, publishing similar papers with historical insights into significant ecological papers, developing an ecology-related board game (maybe reviving Steve Hubbell's successful Extinction game, or an ecology-related version of Monopoly). We have no official policy about collection of data from ESA members, such as making the membership names and addresses available for surveys conducted by others on behalf of ESA, and archiving the original data collected from member surveys. The data behind the original WAMIE study, for example, seem to be lost. Some aspects of this issue will be addressed by the new privacy policy that will be drafted by Katherine and her staff. A new data policy was adopted: “Whenever possible, and consistent with any IRB regulations imposed on the person or persons conducting the survey, data from surveys on behalf of ESA and involving ESA members shall be the property of the Society.” Since its original appointment in 1995 this has been a committee with successive three- or five-year appointments, and the current term ends 31 December 2008. Jackson suggests that this be changed to make the panel a permanent standing committee. A motion is moved, seconded, and approved unanimously: The Board supports extending the Vegetation Panel for an additional three-year term, and requests that the Council consider at the 2009 Annual Meeting a proposal to establish the Vegetation Panel as a permanent standing committee. The Science Office proposes a process and timetable for future ESA Millennium Conferences: A call for proposals will be announced in early September two years before the target year, with proposals due by the end of October. The Past-President will convene an ad-hoc committee of 5–7 members to review proposals, and a winning proposal will be announced by early December. VP for Science will serve as an ex officio member of the organizing committee. A motion is moved, seconded, and approved unanimously: The Board approves the proposal from the Science Office for a process and timetable for future ESA Millennium Conferences. The Board is presented with a Draft Principles for ESA Involvement in Extramural Programs (revised from the July 2008 version). A motion is moved, seconded, and approved unanimously: The Board approves the proposed Principles for ESA Involvement in Extramural Programs, dated October 2008. TIEE has been supported by ESA since 2004, hosting this peer-reviewed electronic publication and providing services of the ESA Education Coordinator. NSF funding for this publication is ending, and Dr. Charlene D'Avanzo, who has led the effort to date, has asked ESA to assume responsibility for TIEE. The Publications Committee has prepared a report, which is presented to the Board. A survey of members of the ESA Education Section (N = 71 responses) found high support for TIEE. Estimated cost of maintaining TIEE is $27,000/yr (primarily Education office staff time, Webmaster time), but this may be an underestimate given the previous grant-funded budget. There is one issue per year, with a significant number of pages; the 2008 issue is close to completion. The Education and Human Resources Committee would need to be involved (one of Teresa's staff members is essentially the managing editor at present), as would Publications (whose membership would have to be changed to reflect the new responsibility). The Board consensus is that TIEE has been a valuable contribution to the ecological education community, but there are still some questions about the financial model and how the transition to ESA would be accomplished. Liz Biggs and Katherine will try to confirm the estimate for an operating budget for continuing TIEE, and the Publications Committee is asked to provide more detail on what TIEE should look like if it became one of our flagship publications, including the balance of pedagogy vs. lab experiments, the identity of the journal's closest competitors, and any ways in which the peer-review process may need to change to make it consistent with ESA practices. Kiyoko Miyanishi, Chair of Meetings Committee, joined the meeting by conference phone. Both Minneapolis and Baltimore are good options, but because of potentially easier media access, she recommends Baltimore for 2015 (the centennial meeting), and Minneapolis for 2013, and the Board concurs. Minneapolis and Fort Lauderdale are offering free use of their convention centers, and ESA hasn't met in Florida for several decades. Fort Lauderdale is a possibility for a meeting after 2015. Norma Fowler will be local host at the Austin meeting. Sharon Strauss (UC Davis) is considering the invitation to be Program Chair and Norm has another person in mind if she declines. ESA includes in the cost of Annual Meeting registration an amount to be used to offset environmental impacts of the meeting. The Local Host Committee was asked to recommend local organizations or projects to support and the Public Affairs Committee was asked to make a recommendation for national and international organizations/projects to which ESA can contribute. The Public Affairs Committee did not have the opportunity to discuss this request and will do so at their upcoming meeting and make a recommendation in time for the May Governing Board meeting. The Local Host Committee will make a recommendation at that meeting as well. Broader impacts beyond the greenhouse gas emissions of travel, including those related to habitat destruction, introduced species, and the spread of human disease could be addressed, and an effort could be made to tailor the focus to local issues (e.g., focus on water at the Albuquerque meeting). Frank Gilliam is the Program Chair for the 2010 meeting in Pittsburgh, and has proposed “Global warming: The legacy of our past, the challenge for our future” as a meeting theme. A motion is moved, seconded, and approved unanimously: The Board approves the proposed theme for the 2010 meeting. The Publications Committee was asked to discuss several suggestions related to Ecological Monographs that grew out of the report from the Ad Hoc Committee on Publications and in conversations with Don Strong, Editor-in-Chief of EM. The Committee recommends that the name of the journal should not be changed, that Associate Editor Aaron Ellison be named Editor-in-Chief of Ecological Monographs, and that he be paid $5000 for this responsibility A motion is moved, seconded, and approved unanimously: The Board supports these recommendations for changes in Ecological Monographs, to appoint Aaron Ellison as Editor-in-Chief with an initial term through December 2011, and offer him compensation of $5000 per year. 19 November 2008 Executive Session 8:30 am ESA's Public Affairs Committee dates back to 1954. In the early 1980s a Public Affairs Office was established, which developed the Ecological Information Network, an ESA Newsletter, and facilitated a Biotech Hill briefing. Interactions tended to focus on collaborating with environmental policy and advocacy groups. The 1990s saw a shift to a facilitator role, press operations began, and there was ESA testimony on wetland issues. There was a focus on science funding, the Public Affairs Officer position was created, communications training and policy sessions were instituted, the first ESA Congressional Fellow and Congressional Visits Day were initiated, as were press releases about papers appearing in ESA journals. A half-time education position was also funded within the PA office. ESA sponsored its first booth on the annual Hill science exhibition, and on average three Hill briefings were held each year. Since the year 2000 the education position has become full time and independent of the PA Office. There are now about 20 Hill and Executive Branch meetings/yr, a Policy Analyst position was created, a second ESA Congressional Fellow was appointed, ESA sends about 10 letters/statements per year, and international media coverage has increased. The PA Committee has originated a number of initiatives for the Society, such as ESA position papers, the ESA Corporate Award, the Opening Plenary at the Annual Meeting, community outreach efforts, hosting policy staff at the Annual Meeting, and development of the Regional Policy Award. The mission of the PA office now is to work with media to convey ecological knowledge, inform national environmental and science policy, and foster federal support for ecological research and education. Media outreach efforts include press releases, the press room at the Annual Meeting, creating podcasts, connecting media to ESA members, writing op-ed pieces, and communications and policy training sessions at the Annual Meeting. Samples of the podcasts were played for the Board. The current portfolio for the PAO related to federal support of ecological research and education includes budget analysis, congressional visits, the annual Hill exhibition about research and education projects funded by NSF, and working with coalitions that focus on different federal agencies of relevance to ecologists. Congressional visits to support funding for all federal agencies that fund ecological research are an important activity that has involved members ranging from graduate students to senior Society leaders. The environmental and science policy part of the portfolio includes conducting (or partnering) in Congressional briefings, field trips for Hill staff, press releases, writing statements (e.g., the recent biofuels statement) and letters (10–12 letters/yr, e.g., the letter from President Power to the Bush administration about proposed changes to the Endangered Species Act), targeted Hill meetings (smaller groups than briefings), and creating and supporting the Rapid Response Teams. Engagement with ESA members includes sending the bimonthly Policy News, the communication training at the Annual Meeting, PAC-sponsored sessions at the Annual Meeting, and the membership of the Public Affairs Committee. Continue to interact with EHRC and Science committees, and with “Issues in Ecology.” Encourage regional rapid response teams; explore “toolkits” for members engaged in local or regional policy issues. Evaluate the 2007 member policy survey. Recognize the new threshold of member expectations (e.g., those making visits to D.C. who want help arranging meetings with legislators). Keep ESA's reputation intact—play to strengths of being the world's largest society of ecological scientists. There may be additional ways to take advantage of the Annual Meeting, e.g., in terms of regional efforts related to the local region. It would be a good idea to remind the membership of the availability of the ESA Policy News listserv (ESANEWS). ESA member Dennis Ojima has proposed development of an ESA Policy Paper “Bioenergy: Options for Decision-making.” The intended audience for policy papers includes federal agencies, Congress, and the media. A two-day meeting is requested, with a budget of $9,000 + publication costs (unspecified). Concern was expressed about the feasibility of addressing this broad topic in a two-day meeting with a relatively small pool of participants. It might be more appropriate to do something on the scale of an NCEAS workshop. It is also uncertain how much this effort would add at this point to the recent activity by the Society on biofuels. Although this is an issue that ESA should continue to be involved in, this particular proposal may be premature given the state of our understanding of the biofuels issue, and not well enough focused. VP for Public Affairs Huenneke will respond to the proposal and encourage a potential future resubmission. A proposal is presented for a continuous long-range planning process that will incorporate the current Program Reviews and Mid-Term Program Reviews. These operational-level reviews seem to be achieving the goal of adaptive management at the program level, but we need to make sure that a broader perspective on ESA priorities is also being addressed. The Board agreed that time beyond the normal semiannual meeting is needed, and scheduled an extra day for the May meeting for this long-range planning. Suggestions were made for a possible facilitator for this meeting. There is some risk in this award, in terms of public relations, but it is an opportunity to try and move industry toward more beneficial ecological activities by recognizing a corporation's activities and holding them up as a role model. Receipt of this award has not had an effect on corporate giving to the Society, and we have no information about how it may have affected corporate behavior. Given the apparent cost/benefit ratio of this award, the consensus is that we should not give the award this year and should re-think the reasoning behind the award as part of our long-range planning. This could be considered as part of an outreach effort to a nonacademic, private-sector audience. The May meeting is scheduled for 18–20 May 2009, with the first day to be devoted to a long-term strategic planning process. No new business. Meeting is adjourned at 12:16 pm.","citation":"David W.

Resumen de Revisión: Pocos estudios sobre conservación de biodiversidad y recursos naturales en regiones de conflicto interno ofrecen un contexto global e histórico adecuado. El libro Guerra, Sociedad y Medio Ambiente coloca la historia socioeconómica colombiana y el conflicto armado al centro de las discusiones sobre el medio ambiente. Los primeros capítulos presentan marcos generales sobre la relación entre los grupos armados y el medio ambiente, y dos capítulos intermedios evalúan el desarrollo de políticas ambientales en medio de la guerra. La segunda mitad del libro está dedicada a las materias primas, petróleo y cultivos ilícitos, y a las carreteras y su papel en la fragmentación de bosques. Según los autores hace falta más democracia participativa y transparencia para que los recursos naturales de Colombia no continúen alimentando el conflicto armado. En el fondo, la destrucción del medio ambiente es el resultado de conflictos de interés entre poderes desiguales. La protección de los recursos naturales dependerá del apoyo, voluntad y respeto de las comunidades locales, pero nada se logra si estas últimas no tienen voz ni voto. Esto hace que la democracia sea indispensable para la conservación en Colombia y en todo el mundo. Although most conservationists would agree that war or peace matters to their endeavors, few have investigated the subject as central to stemming the loss of biodiversity and ecosystem services. In the meantime, dozens of internal armed conflicts rage from Congo to Indonesia, seldom reaching the international spotlight. We can expect at least some of these wars to integrate into regional and global power struggles, and thus escalate in magnitude and visibility, as the national security agenda in the United States crystallizes into foreign policy and brings the considerable resources of that nation to bear. And yet most biological conservation studies in areas of armed conflict offer minimal historical or global context, and then mostly as an afterthought. Guerra, Sociedad y Medio Ambiente, edited by Martha Cárdenas and Manuel Rodríguez, is unique in framing environmental conservation and degradation solidly within Colombia's socioeconomic circumstance and its armed conflict. This book is the result of discussions at the Foro Nacional Ambiental (National Environment Forum), an open medium aiming to mainstream environmentalism within Colombian development policies. As such, its 10 chapters embody as many academic disciplines and range from the mostly empirical (e.g., Rodríguez on community reforestation programs) to the mostly conceptual (e.g., Fontaine on the sociology of environmental degradation arising from oil extraction). The first three chapters (Rangel, Fajardo, and Andrade) provide a general introduction by analyzing the complex interactions between the biophysical environment and the creation and maintenance of armed guerrillas and counterinsurgencies throughout the country. This is where we learn that a single Colombian pipeline has spilled enough oil to fill the Exxon Valdez several times over courtesy of a thousand guerrilla attacks; that the war has forcibly closed dozens of field stations, making resource management educated guesswork; and that the countryside is increasingly depopulated, but not better off for it because smallholder plots are consolidated at gunpoint into unproductive cattle ranches. Armed groups have become agents and enablers of legal and illegal resource exploitation in the forested frontier, building roads and burning forests as they see fit and probably transforming their vast and remote dominions into megafauna-free forests. Fajardo blames this recent history on the state's commitment to economic liberalization and its unwillingness to strengthen the smallholder economy. An all-encompassing agrarian policy to maximize productivity, social justice, and food security is the proposed remedy. The current state of affairs, a mix of official market fundamentalism and de facto survival of the most heavily armed, is an obvious humanitarian and environmental failure. But Fajardo's vision must give us pause: Who decides where, when, and how to produce? What is the role of individual initiative in this central planner's dream? For Andrade the answer lies in greater governance and accountability within the current system—accountability because the state seems to attend to external demands more readily than to the needs of communities within, and governance to restore the rule of law to the lawless hinterland. But this model quickly breaks down when confronted with what Andrade rightly calls a globalized environment. Colombia exports most of the legal and illegal commodities carved out of its lush forests. These markets are shaped by policies articulated and enforced globally (e.g., war on drugs, war on terror, and free trade for agricultural and manufactured products). Their tangible consequences are local. This is probably why half the book is devoted to commodities and the roads that take them to the world. Oil and illegal drugs receive two chapters each (Avellaneda and Fontaine for the former, Ortiz and Vargas for the latter), and Castaño offers what might be the first article to relate fragmentation by roads with culture rather than only with economics. Avellaneda describes the social and environmental costs of oil exploitation in Colombia in disturbing detail. In general, a multinational corporation in collusion with the state opens virgin land for exploration leading to a rush of colonization that displaces or exterminates local and/or indigenous people and destroys the forest. Over decades of extraction the company amasses inordinate profits, pays local workers a pittance, and lines the pockets of authorities that look the other way when the company dumps waste into the soil and waterways. Devastation and the consolidation of land for cattle ranching follow in their wake. This process has repeated itself for more than 100 years, unraveling the social fabric of countless campesino communities, along with the Kofán, Inga, Barí, and U'wa, and ravaging formerly productive fisheries from Amazonia to the Caribbean. These graphic case studies contrast with the abstraction inherent to theoretical sociology in the following chapter. For Fontaine, conflicts between different stakeholders in oil exploitation in Colombia and Ecuador are both expressions of the power asymmetry that separates the state and corporations from indigenous tribes and campesinos, and examples of clashing interests (economic or not) mediated by cultural identity. As it stands, the chapter succeeds in outlining a structural framework for understanding the conflict over oil, but proceeds no further. The analysis would be more valuable if it identified strategies out of the confusing dynamics of social and environmental conflicts and thus suggested specific action. This is exactly what Castaño does in his essay on roads, forests, and social conflict. After evaluating the condition of roads in the nation (poor overall), Castaño explains in detail the project to integrate to the legal economy the marginal areas where armed conflict and illicit crops thrive. The Vías para la Paz project, one of the social components of the much criticized Plan Colombia is currently, paving roads in Putumayo (on the East Andes/Amazonia interface), southwestern Colombia (linking the West Andes and parts of the south Central Andes to ports on the Pacific), and the Serranía de San Lucas and adjacent lowlands. If these names are familiar it is because these are regions of high priority for the conservation of birds (Álvarez 2002) and the ecosystems that support them. How to curb the destruction of these sensitive forests when fragmentation has always followed road construction? The basic principles to ameliorate conflict between conservation and development, as formulated at a workshop organized in part by the parks system (then headed by Castaño), and the recommendations that follow can be summarized in one word: democracy. Three points deserve to be highlighted. First, conservation is more than preservation; a strategy for parks is already in place, but a wider management agenda remains to be formulated in consultation with as many (particularly local) stakeholders as possible. Second, the conflict over land tenure is a structural cause of both violence and deforestation. Progressive taxation and the redistribution of lands seized from drug traffickers, in combination with collective tenure for traditional communities, should be the instruments of a new agrarian reform. Third, conflict, not negotiation, has been normalized in daily life. Only more participation and transparency in decision making will reverse this condition. If government-built roads and legally regulated oil companies have been accessories to so much environmental degradation, what then of illegal drugs? In each of their chapters, Ortiz and Vargas examine the damage caused not so much by illicit crops per se but by the aerial fumigation with glyphosate that the government uses in its hitherto elusive attempt to eradicate them. Neither author believes aerial spraying is environmentally innocuous (Cavelier & Etter 1995), and both marshal quantitative data from all regions of Colombia to show just how appalling a failure fumigation has been. Together, these chapters read as empirical verification of ideas introduced by the authors in an earlier volume (Castañeda et al. 2001). Vargas counters the report of 16% reduction in coca cultivation between 2002 and 2003 (Green 2004) with figures to show that fumigated areas bleed refugees and that the number of departamentos where illicit crops are grown has in fact increased. This means that illicit crops and, eventually, aerial spraying, are reaching new virgin lands and probably ecosystems as yet untouched. Contents of the interviews conducted by Ortiz hint at the obstacles to eradication. Campesinos confess that coca money allowed them to put their children through school. Local authorities wonder why alternative development plans were imposed from above and not concerted with deference to their location, resources, or management capacity. The conclusion is evident: a society where the opportunity cost of basic education is so high that marginalized campesinos can access it only with illegal money is in a kind of trouble that cannot be solved with herbicide. Thus Ortiz exposes the marginalization that drives the growth of illicit crops in the Andes and around the world. In a strange twist, and detracting from otherwise sound arguments, we are informed that illegal drugs are only so because of a failure in semiotics. If only we ascribed a different meaning to these substances, then no harm would come from their production, commerce, or consumption. I doubt this. Although the current strategy seems hopeless, no amount of revisionism can erase the long trail of blood and environmental destruction inherent to the international drug trade. In a book including as many perspectives as this, a silver lining is inevitable. Two chapters (Correa and Rodríguez) are devoted to advances in the implementation of environmental policy. Correa examines Parques con la Gente (Parks with the People), a translation into public environmental policy of the democratizing impulse that gave Colombia its 1991 constitution and the necessary framework for protecting and managing the fourth of the country (>45 million hectares) that officially encompasses national parks and other protected areas, both public and private, and the territories devolved to indigenous and black communities. The main goal is to strengthen the national protected area system by fostering the participation of society in planning and managing for conservation from the bottom up. As with every other aspect of public policy in Colombia, war is a constant risk that the policy acknowledges and internalizes. The construction of viable dialog in the midst of conflict could go a long way toward resolving the real grievances underlying the struggle for land. The policy is too new to evaluate on the ground, but among its chief weaknesses are the imminent clash with omnipotent national security mandates and the lack of independent financing. Can democracy really bring about the conservation and sustainable development of natural resources, even biodiversity? The results of the Plan Verde (Green Plan) community reforestation project, as presented and analyzed by Rodríguez, suggest it can. The project used money from the World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank to reforest water catchments in depressed campesino communities through regional conservation authorities (Corporaciones Autónomas Regionales[CARs]). Each CAR prioritized areas to be reforested and then channeled 80% of the resources to plant and maintain forests over 3 years to the local community, which contributed labor. About 87,000 ha out of the 100,000 stated as a goal were reforested. The project planted more than 200 species, 80% native to Colombia, in more than 2000 catchments. Intangible benefits included the development or strengthening of community agroforestry and the sense of commitment from campesinos, probably enhanced by increased property values at the project sites. Rodríguez acknowledges the limits of this approach in conserving biodiversity and devotes some thoughts as to how similar strategies could apply to other ecosystems or to natural regeneration. Because it provided rural employment and involved local authorities, most armed groups acquiesced in the projects. There are, of course, projects that could not be completed because of the territorial disputes between armed groups, and Rodríguez wonders if the CAR might not have excluded some areas from consideration for security reasons. It is also possible that armed groups extorted Plan Verde money from the community. If so, this would probably go unreported. That impoverished campesinos were willing to change the long-term use of part of their land, from field to forest, in exchange for what were doubtlessly modest incentives should be heartening to conservationists. The fact that they did so almost in the crossfire is nothing short of heroic. What Colombia's armed conflict makes starkly clear is that a bloody conflict of interest between unequal powers is at the core of much environmental destruction. Only the commitment of empowered locals protects the land in the long run.

conservation biologists from around the globe travel to Beijing for the 2009 annual meeting of the Society for Conservation Biology (SCB) hosted by the Chinese Academy of Sciences, they bring with them basic knowledge about biodiversity and environmental issues in the People's Republic of China (PRC). China is a megadiversity country, harboring about 12% of the flowering plants, 10% of mammals, and 14% of birds living on Earth. The PRC is one of the few countries that contain two global biodiversity hotspots; many species in these hotspots and throughout the country are Chinese endemics. China is also the homeland for rice and soybeans, agricultural staples on which billions of humans depend. Since 1956 the central government has acted on behalf of China's natural ecosystems, designating over 2500 protected areas across 15% of the country's land. In comparison with the United States, China has reserved more lands in considerably less time. Attendees of the SCB meeting are also aware of the tremendous environmental problems facing the PRC. Symbolized by the giant panda (Ailuropeda melanoleuca), the tiger (Panthera tigris), and the Asian elephant (Elaphus maximus), a host of China's unique species are endangered. Many of the PRC's protected areas do not function well because of inadequate staffing and funding and often amount to mere paper parks. Conservation problems in China are exacerbated by the still-developing rule of law, and decentralized political authority, in which strong national environmental policies butt up against weak local implementation. There is a general disconnect between conservation science and management. China's rapid economic rise has not helped conservation much. The country faces severe environmental challenges as the largest human population in history builds highways, factories, and housing to fully join the modern industrial world. The PRC, however, remains relatively poor. Per capita income in 2007 was a mere one-fifth of the U.S. average; a typical American teenager has more discretionary income than the total annual salary of the average Chinese citizen. Despite the importance of biodiversity issues, we want to draw attention to less-discussed environmental concerns that involve China at regional and global scales and which will likely transform life for all of us over the rest of the 21st century. China's overarching development goal is laudable: \"to build a well-off society in an all-round way\" to transform the PRC into a modern, developed nation. From 1980 to 2000, China expanded its economy by a factor of 4, while only doubling energy use. For the midterm out to 2020, Beijing wants to repeat this impressive feat. To grasp the consequences of this scale of projected growth, consider that China's spectacular rise is but halfway completed. Projections out to 2020 for just two sectors—automobile ownership and urban expansion—portray the magnitude of what is coming next. In 2000 there were only 8 million cars on China's roads. At the end of 2008, there were some 48 million, a per capita rate of ownership matching the U.S. level in 1915. For 2020 projections of auto ownership range from 100 to 130 million. The rate of urban expansion surpasses the spectacular growth in automobiles. Today, one of every two buildings in the world is being constructed in the PRC. By 2020 China's cities will need to accommodate some 300 million new residents, the current population of the United States, so construction must proceed at a blistering pace to erect—in 11 years—as many new square meters of buildings as currently exist in America. Much of this construction will pave over arable lands, which are already in short supply in China, and few projects are guided by environmental planning. The challenge is that China simply does not have the domestic natural resources and energy supplies to quadruple the size of its economy, build megacities, satisfy the burgeoning middle class, and provide hundreds of millions of its poor people with a developed-world standard of living. Some 40% of all consumer goods bought in the United States are imported from China, but to comprehend potential environmental impacts of China's planned development trajectory, one must follow the flow of raw materials imported into the PRC. To relieve its growing oil and natural gas deficit, China is negotiating with multiple neighbors—Russia, Kazakhstan, Pakistan, India, and Myanmar—to build at least eight Alaska-pipeline-scale projects across some of the least-developed lands in the world, including several national parks and one World Heritage Site, all with little to no environmental impact analyses. To the south, in the Greater Mekong Basin, China is seeking to electrify southeast Asia by investing in 85 dams in Laos PDR, Myanmar, and Cambodia. Many of these projects will flood national parks and existing biodiversity-conservation corridors and displace hundreds of thousands of rural people. None of these host countries feature strong environmental impact assessment, although some attempts are being made to change this. Scaling up beyond the region, China is using the immense profits generated by being the low-cost factory to the world to finance some 200 dams in over 48 countries across four continents. These include a project in Borneo slated to become the largest dam in south Asia and a dam in the Democratic Republic of Congo that would cost US$80 billion and surpass the size of Three Gorges Dam to become the single largest hydropower project in the world. Details on most of these projects are not available due to lack of government and private-sector transparency, but the cumulative impacts will be immense. Some perspective on China's international dam-building efforts is warranted. After all, before 2000, the hydropower track record of the United States and other countries was poor. In that year, however, the World Commission on Dams released a comprehensive critique that most observers expected would change the rules of hydropower development forever. But a short decade later, Chinese investors are stepping in to fill the open niche of global dam developer with few strings attached. There is no international protocol in place to ensure best environmental practices. Of course, the carbon footprint of China's ongoing development out to 2020 and beyond is the most problematic aspect of China's rise. China, like India, depends on burning coal to fuel its incredible growth. Despite the Kyoto Protocol, since 2000 global growth in carbon dioxide emissions has increased. Although China adds the equivalent of France's entire energy grid each year, it is not just power production that contributes to the country's rising emissions. Of all the billions of square meters of buildings under construction today that will serve the citizens of China tomorrow, 95% do not meet Beijing's codes for energy efficiency. Even if the European Union and the United States magically reduced their greenhouse gas emissions to zero while you are reading this sentence, China's current pace by itself may keep global emissions rising through 2020. China should not be blamed for the world's runaway greenhouse gas emissions; the United States never even ratified the Kyoto Protocol. And we emphasize that China's development dream is not a vision exclusive to the PRC. Beyond the Middle Kingdom, there are at least 1.2 billion people desiring cars, a decent house attached to a sewer system, potable water, and a fair measure of education and health care. Last year Jared Diamond distilled reams of data into one simple ratio—32:1 (Diamond 2008). That is the average annual amount of oil, electricity, and just plain stuff that an advertising executive in Los Angeles or a postal clerk in Sydney consumes compared with a dryland farmer in Henan Province or a Tibetan guesthouse manager in northwest Yunnan. Diamond assigned the developed world rate to everyone living in China and the United States and found that this level of consumption was equivalent to a total human population of 13 billion. Diamond then added in all Indians; this bumped humanity's ecological footprint up to 19.5 billion. When Diamond included every poor person on Earth as if they ate steak, drove sedans, and used electricity to read at night like Americans, Japanese, and Germans, he discovered that the planet would need to support 72 billion humans. Which planet do we want to live on? We are aware that most people today do not own cars or credit cards or have indoor flush toilets. We cannot conceive of Earth supporting Diamond's low-end 13 billion people, twice the current population. The ultimate importance of the PRC's growing economic and ecological footprint is this: China and the rest of the less-developed world are driving wealthy countries toward a global reckoning with the fossil-fuel-powered, high-consumption, industrial way of life. A well-known Chinese proverb cautions that an opportunity may provide a blessing or a curse. The potential boon here is that the scramble to make room at the table for developing world citizens may wean all of us off coal and oil with utmost haste. The darker portent is that the already-wealthy world is not willing to share, inadequately prepared to do so, or simply unable to act in time. China may appear an unlikely catalyst for promoting sustainable alternatives to business as usual. But China is different. Even as its astounding growth has brought global environmental issues to a boil, the PRC is poised to assume a leadership role in solving international problems. Since 2004 President Hu Jintao and Premier Wen Jiabao have promoted hexie shehui (harmonious society) spotlighting an \"environment-friendly\" culture featuring energy efficiency. Beijing is pushing the world's most aggressive increases in all forms of renewable energy. The Party has committed to a national target of 20% of energy from nonfossil fuel sources by 2020. Next year China will have tripled its wind-energy capacity in just 3 years. The country has under construction or approved enough nuclear power plants to double this source of energy from current levels. Within the government bureaucracy, energy-saving performance standards are already in place that will influence job promotions. We are aware that harmonious society rhetoric has mostly been offered to maintain domestic social stability, but the central government still has room to project hexie shehui out beyond the PRC. In the Mekong basin, for example, upstream China could partner with neighboring countries downstream to create a hydropower system that would not deplete water and food resources. Some of the world's most rapid and steep temperature increases due to climate change are projected to occur in the Greater Himalayas region. The projected loss of glacial ice and snow from the world's \"third pole\" is alarming; 1.5 billion people are sustained by Asia's \"water tower,\" the rivers that flow down from the world's highest mountains (e.g., the Mekong, Yangze, Ganges, Indus, and Tarim rivers). Of all the lands in the Greater Himalayas, some 75% are within the PRC, and Chinese scientists have done the best work defining regional water issues. Yet neither Beijing nor New Delhi have acted to convene a summit of Himalayan nations to deal with this issue. If these two nations do not lead the way, who will? And as China continues to invest in dams and other infrastructure around the world, there is no reason why it cannot bring best international practices to environmental planning and increase its stature in the world by serving as a role model for responsible development. China might also benefit from combining its traditional Confucian vision of tuanjie (unity) with its political objective of an international order influenced by multiple countries, not just a few. After all, even conservative Chinese policy analysts note that \"a Harmonious Society cannot be built in just one country.\" A TV or toy made in China bound for a mall in Minneapolis leaves its carbon footprint in the PRC, but with no foreign consumer, there is no demand for the product. The Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research in the United Kingdom has estimated that some 23% of China's total emissions result from net exports to the developed world. The Earth's atmosphere bears a message: we are all in this together. China and climate change have collapsed us and them into we. In the United States President Barak Obama was elected as a candidate of change; global warming will see to that. With the United States and PRC together responsible for 40% of current greenhouse gas emissions, President Obama and President Hu Jintao should meet in China well before the Copenhagen climate meeting in December 2009 to jump-start what will doubtless be some of the most important negotiations in history. Economic recession makes none of these steps easy. But perhaps the global slowdown has a silver lining—world leaders can shape a response that begins to build a carbon-neutral world out of the shell of the old. After all, when the recession recedes, we cannot return to blindly pumping CO2 out of tailpipes and smokestacks. As conservation biologists converge on Beijing, we encourage visitors to reach out to international peers, soak up alternative perspectives, and create new professional connections. We invite colleagues to think holistically about the global context of specific research projects in the light of imminent environmental perturbations. Like a 500-year-old Ming porcelain vase, brittle with a hundred hairline fractures yet still in one piece, China, although doing its best, still lacks the resilience to withstand additional ecological shocks to the system. Nevertheless, we believe that although China is shaking the world today, it will shape the world tomorrow. The questions are, when will China exert new environmental leadership and how will the rest of the world respond?","citation":"R. Edward Grumbine & Jianchu Xu (2009)","page":"chunk_3_1"}

is considered as one of world’s highest priority in biodiversity conservation. This is linked not only with the high degree of diversity and endemism but also the ongoing threats of the natural communities. However, efforts have been underway at different levels in Madagascar with the new vision Madagascar Naturally and the proposed five year plan Madagascar Action Plan (MAP), to protect and valorise the unique and rich biological diversity, in collaboration with all stakeholders, including the International communities. The new Protected Areas System of Madagascar represent an important benchmark in an overall plan for conservation and sustainable development, first unveiled by Excellency President Marc Ravalomanana at the World Parks Congress in Durban, South Africa in 2003. The President committed to increase the total size of protected areas to 10 % of the country’s territory, from 1.7 million hectares to 6 million hectares, in a five-year period to ensure the conservation of these unique biodiversity. One of the key aims of the new Protected Areas System of Madagascar is to strengthen the integration of Conservation and Development for sustainable management of resources. In addition, the involvement and empowerment of stakeholders, including local communities, traditional leaders, private sectors, government or non government organizations, play an important role in this new system of protected areas. The Ministry of Environment, Water and Forests, has targeted about one million hectares of protected areas to be classified each year, to reach this objective of six millions hectares over five years. The first one million hectares of this system of protected areas has been classified in 2005, and the classification of the next one million hectares for 2006 is going to the right direction. In addition to the declaration of the President of Madagascar in Durban, recently during the General Assembly of the United Nations in New York in September 2005, the President of Madagascar has also announced to allocate 8 % of the cancelled external debt of Madagascar, to support biodiversity conservation and environmental management, for sustainable financing of all efforts in Madagascar Conserving the natural communities is critical not only to biodiversity, but also to the people who rely on the resources for their livelihoods. Conservation does not mean full protection, and exclude human being. We all need to understand that conservation includes sustainable management, protection and preservation. The importance of zoning would play an important role in this undertaking. One would need to consider a zoned area that could be harvested with control, another one for ecotourism, another zone for protection and so on. To live in a safe and healthy environment does not only mean protecting species in their natural habitat, but also enhancing the life quality of each citizen. Therefore it is very important that we all work together to achieve this goal and that conservation efforts go hand in hand with development. I welcome this new journal MADAGASCAR CONSERVATION & DEVELOPMENT as it deals largely and exclusively with Conservation and/or Development in Madagascar. Biodiversity Conservation would not go alone without Development and vice versa. I encourage Malagasy researchers, students, decision makers to contribute to this journal as this new journal aims to provide a forum for exchange of information and experiences, about all aspects of conservation and development work in Madagascar. It will also play an important role as an early warning for interested people to threats to nature and culture as they arise. Therefore, this new journal arrives at the right time, as it will provide a kit for both, conservation and development practitioners in Madagascar. I wish a long life to the MADAGASCAR CONSERVATION & DEVELOPMENT new journal, and warm congratulations to its Editorial Board. Sincerely Yours, Joelisoa Ratsirarson, Ph.D.","citation":"Joelisoa Ratsirarson (2006)","page":"chunk_3_1"}

to a growing interest in biodiversity issues, plant ecology research in Brazil in the past decades has predominantly aimed to produce descriptive accounts of vegetation structure, floristics and phytosociology. However, following the tradition of the notable Brazilian ecologists of the 40’s and 50’s, several studies conducted by a distinctive group of young Brazilian researchers were characteristically concerned with the relationship between plants and theirs physical and chemical environment. Thus, the main purpose of this volume is to review the bulk of achievements of this group of functional ecologists in order to call the attention of our expressive new generation of plant ecologists to functional and adaptive mechanisms related to plant survival and growth in environments subjected to seasonal drought or flooding. Therefore, the reviews were grouped under two sections, namely Xerophytic Plants and Amphibious Plants . The reviews altogether quote over 700 references gathering tropical examples of plant life strategies, contemporary theoretical issues related to stress ecophysiology, and modern techniques for measuring and assessing plant fitness, survival and productivity. Despite all this effort there are many gaps still to be filled. We hope this volume will contribute to point out directions for future research. We are indebted to the Brazilian Botanical Society (SBB) who let us organize the Ecophysiology Symposium in the XLVII Congresso Nacional de Botânica (22, 23/vi/1996), where these reviews were presented. CNPq, RHAE/Meio Ambiente ans SBBB financed the trip of the invited researchers. The Post-Graduate Program in Ecology of Federal University of Rio de Janeiro allocated funds for the edition of this volume. We are particularly thankful to the reviewers, whose comments improved the quality of the present reviews; and to Prof. Dorothy Sue Dunn de Araujo who patiently improved the English language used in all chapters. Considering that one of the main goals of the series Oecologia Brasiliensis is to attend the demand for literature of the vast number of Brazilian students of Ecology and that the three previous volumes were issued in Portuguese, it is worth to mention that the present volume was written in English for two reasons. The main reason is that the reduced number of Brazilian specialist on the theme dealt with here required the review of the articles were done by foreign researchers; secondly, we believe that in such manner we contribute to launch the series beyond our geographical borders.

Ehhez egyertelműen hozzajarult a rovidlato gazdasagpolitika is. Ugyanakkor a media hajlamos az elelmiszerarak ugrasszerű novekedeset inkabb a feltorekvő gazdasagok (pl.

A vizsgalt tenyezők egy resze rovidebb, a masik hosszabb tavon fejti ki hatasat. Mig pl. a termeles visszaesese a vezető agrartermelő es -exportőr orszagokban inkabb csak even belul (ciklikusan) befolyasolja a piacokat, egyes makrogazdasagi tenyezők sokeves időszakon ativelő strukturalis valtozasokat ideznek elő.

Az engedelyezes harmonizaciojanak hianya oda vezetett, hogy mig egy-egy GM termeny termelese, forgalmazasa, felhasznalasa a vilag szamos orszagaban engedelyezett, az Europai Unioban tilos. A nem engedelyezett GM termenyekkel szembeni zerustolerancia komolyan hat a jelenben es a jovőben is az EU szojabab, kukorica, illetve ezek szarmazekos termekei (szojadara, kukoricagluten-takarmany, DDGS) behozatalara.

A vilag mind tobb orszagaban fognak GM novenyeket termeszteni fuggetlenul attol, hogy az Europai Unio milyen gyorsan, illetve egyaltalan engedelyezi azokat vagy sem. Az is nyilvanvalo, hogy a Kozosseg nem kepes csokkenteni fuggőseget a mezőgazdasagi nyersanyagimporttol.

The food-price index of FAO between January 2006 and January 2008 increased by more than 60%. Variations in prices did occur before but the latest price shocks were caused by a number of factors acting concurrently. Of these the depletion of the world’s corn and oil-seed supply takes possibly no.1 position: the balance sheet of Earth’s food supply has not shown such little reserves for decades. Short-sighted economic policies inevitably contributed to the present situation. At the same time the international media tends to lay the blame on the transformation of food consumption in some developing economics (e.g. China and India) and on increased use of agricultural crops for bio-fuel productions. We can divide the factors causing the price shock into three categories: 1. Factors of ecological and biological nature affecting agriculture and trade. 2. Factors affecting the macro-economic environment (increases in population and consumers’ income, drastic increases in world oil prices, etc). 3. Factors arising from agricultural and commercial policies (trade limiting measures, reforms, incentives for bio-fuel production, etc). Some of the examined factors bring about change on short term, whereas others on long term. While decline in production of leading agricultural producers and exporters may affect markets over a period of a single year (cyclically), some macro-economic factors may bring about structural changes that span over many years. The application of bio-technology is one of the tools for alleviating the “unpleasant side-effects” of cyclical oscillations and fundamental structural alterations for stabilizing the markets. The random occurrence of GMO’s banned by the European Union displays zero tolerance in spite of the fact that their distribution is allowed in any other third country. The practice of EU licensing procedure differs significantly from that of a third country especially in terms of time. While the procedure of EU licensing may often take three years, the procedure in the US for example can be completed within 15 months showing the green light to cultivation of a new GM line. The lack of common licensing procedure leads to a situation where the production, distribution and use of some GM crops are allowed in a number of different countries in the world whereas they are banned in the European Union. Zero tolerance of banned GM products will seriously affect both at present and in the future the imports of GM soya and maize and their derivatives (soya groats, maize gluten feed, DDGS) into the EU. This is a concern because the European Community has been for many years unable to satisfy her internal demand of high protein fodder from own resources, much of it is imported from South and North America, where a considerable fraction of exporting countries produce soya, rape and maize manipulated by gene technology. In future a number of new GM products are expected to be introduced into the EU markets. Agricultural production will still be concentrated on land used at present where increase in productivity is the primary task. This places unavoidably the emphasis on the application of bio-technology. GM crops will be produced in an increasing number of countries throughout the world whether or not the European Union will or will not license their marketing. It is also evident that the community is unable to reduce her dependence on imports of agricultural row materials. Therefore the EU faces two possibilities: either she accepts reductions of internal food supply and increases of food imports (especially meat products) or accepts the changes in international markets and subjects her politically and emotionally not unmotivated licensing procedures to this situation while maintaining strict risk assessment. The creation of a balance between food, energy and environment security is an important task in the EU. The appropriate listing of priorities is a controversial subject in member countries, because that is what determines future reforms of the present system of agricultural supports. But this is important also because the food industry has to compete for land (water resource) usage with the fodder, energy and chemical industries (manufacture of degradable wrapping material) and the demands of environmental protection, biodiversity and recreation puts further value on arable land. The list of priorities for food, energy and environment security seriously affects the finance of the common agricultural policy (CAP) for the period of 2013-2020.","citation":"József Popp & Norbert Potori (2008)","page":"chunk_3_1"}

of ecological goods and services at the local level is often related to benefits at higher governmental levels. On the one hand, sustainable watershed management and biodiversity conservation are strongly connected to local land-use decisions. On the other hand, related conservation activities and protected areas are frequently associated with regional, national or even global public goods. Therefore, spatial externalities or spillover effects exist that – if not adequately compensated – lead to an under-provision of the public goods and services concerned. This chapter investigates fiscal transfers as an innovative instrument for compensating local jurisdictions for the ecological goods and services they provide across local boundaries. From a public finance perspective, fiscal transfers are a suitable instrument for internalising spatial externalities. A case study is presented that investigates the present and potential use of fiscal transfers for ecological public functions in the German federal systems. Analysis of the German system of fiscal equalisation at the local level shows that, so far, mostly end-of-the-pipe activities are currently considered with resource protection and nature conservation being widely underrepresented.","citation":"Irene Ring (2007)","page":"chunk_3_1"}

is a signatory to the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD). This is a reflection of the country's commitment to the conservation and sustainable management of biodiversity. Further, in decision V1/26 the Conference of Parties, in which Uganda participated, adopted the strategic plan for the CBD. Parties committed themselves to a more effective and coherent implementation of the objectives of the convention to achieve, by 2010, a significant reduction in the current rate of biodiversity loss at the global, regional and national level, as a contribution to poverty alleviation and to the benefit of all. In recent years, national policies have been reviewed by the line ministries and/or lead agencies to ensure that they conform to the provisions of CBD. Below ground biodiversity (BGBD) contributes a wide range of essential services to the sustainable functions of all ecosystems, by acting as the primary driving agents of nutrient cycling, regulating the dynamics of soil organic matter, soil carbon sequestration and greenhouse gas emission, modifying soil physical structure and water regime, enhancing the amount and efficiency of nutrient acquisition by the vegetation through mycorrhiza and nitrogen fixing bacteria and influencing plant health through the interaction of pathogens and pests with natural predators and parasites. These services are not only essential to the function of natural ecosystems but also constitute an important resource for the sustainable management of agricultural ecosystems. One of the activities undertaken during the project development process was country documentation of the state of knowledge on the issues related to conservation and management of below ground diversity and capacity building. This publication consists of five papers, each addressing a key BGBD functional group. The first deals with macrofauna, the second with soil pests and pathogens, the third with rhizosphere microbiota, the fourth with soil macrosymbionts and the fifth with decomposer microbiota. The publication will no doubt guide the formulation of strategies for conservation and sustainable management of BGBD in Uganda. The publication presents part of the findings of the global project Conservation and Management of BGBD (CSM-BGBD). The project is implemented in seven tropical countries, namely Brazil, Cote d'Ivore, India, Indonesia, Kenya, Mexico and Uganda. It is executed by TSBF-CIAT, with co-financing from the Global Environmental Facility and implementation support from the United Nations Environmental Programme. The authors appreciate the support of Makerere University, the national executing agency, and the National Agricultural Research Organization, the collaborating institution. The project's national and global co-ordination offices rendered invaluable assistance.","citation":"Mary J. N. Okwakol (2007)","page":"chunk_3_1"}

International Finance Corporation (IFC) Safeguard Policies have been the basis for IFC's leadership and approach to environmental and social sustainability. Based largely on the World Bank's operational policies, IFC adopted its current set of Safeguard Policies in 1998 in order to manage environmental and social issues in the private sector business environment in emerging markets. IFC embarked on an ambitious two-year process in FY04 to update all of the Safeguard Policies through a single initiative to develop the next generation of a policy framework based on a clear, concise and comprehensive policy on social and environmental sustainability. Following an intensive review and analysis of the strengths, weaknesses, and gaps in coverage of the current Safeguard Policies, IFC has recast the Safeguards as a Policy and Performance Standards on Social and Environmental Sustainability.The Performance Standards are often considered the defacto standards even in the absence of IFC participation in the project. They could potentially apply to all projects in developing countries.The Performance Standards contain clear and concise requirements geared toward project outcomes and promote performance improvement through monitoring, reporting and feedback. They place new emphasis on implementation through management systems, deal with social and environmental issues in a more integrated manner, and strengthen policy coverage of issues such as pollution, climate change, and biodiversity. In addition, the Performance Standards address a number of additional subjects of direct concern to the private sector such as labor and working conditions and community health and safety.IFC's social and environmental standards are the building blocks for our approach to sustainability and are embodied in IFC's Safeguard policies, Environmental Health and Safety Guidelines, and Disclosure Policy. Together these provide a framework to help our clients manage project risks and improve their performance, and help IFC improve development outcomes and maximize the development impact of our investments.","citation":"Patty Miller (2006)","page":"chunk_3_1"}

Instituto Nacional de Biodiversidad (INBio) is a non-profit making scientific institution with social orientation, created in 1989, whose main mission is to promote a new awareness of the value of biodiversity and thereby achieve its conservation in Costa Rica. The nematode subprogram was initiated officially in 1998 in close cooperation with the Universidad Nacional of Heredia and financed by the Netherlands government. We conducted a nematode inventory in five conservation areas of Costa Rica, chosen because they contain the most representative and diverse ecosystems of the country. Several hundred samples were collected and referenced with a GPS navigator. All contrasting morphotypes from each sample were represented and stored permanently on Cobb’s slides. The reference nematode collection of INBio contains 18 844 specimens, distributed as follows: Dorylamida (39.6%), Rhab-ditida (17.8%), Araeolaimida (10.3%), Tylenchida (9.0%), Enoplida (9.4%), Mononchida (8.8%), Chromadorida (1.8%), Aphelenchida (2.1%), Monhys-terida (1.1%) and Mermithida (0.2%). Most of the collection is identified at genus level; only 7% is identified at species level of which 14 are new to science. The interaction with international taxonomists is essential to both train INBio staff and generate knowledge related to tropical nematode diversity.","citation":"Alejandro Esquivel & Hans Arias (2004)","page":"chunk_3_1"}

Vth World Parks Congress to be held in Durban, South Africa, September 8-17, 2003 will evaluate progress in protected areas conservation and stipulate strategic policies for the coming decade. Most countries of the world have at least a collection of protected areas, and have signed the Convention on Biological Diversity, while considerable international funding has been established to help developing countries finance their conservation commitment. Yet only few countries have had the opportunity to systematically select biodiversity in such a way that together, their protected areas form a realistic system in which the majority of national biological heritage may find a reasonably secure refuge. Protected Areas System Synthesis and Monitoring  provides scientifically argumented methods and tools for the design of rational protected areas systems, their monitoring and an approximation of their costs. While in the 1970s, conservationists throughout the world were distressed about an apparent destruction of much of the biological wealth and beauty of nature on earth, scientists struggled with defining what needed to be conserved, how much and what needed to be done. The study presents computer programmes and techniques on how to identify and map biodiversity using ecological surrogates to spatially distinguish species assemblages.For a long time, ecosystem mapping has been possible from aerial photographs, and this was applied in some parts of Africa, in Belize and in Western Europe on a moderate scale. Interpretation was slow and the photographs were expensive and national sets were often incomplete. As a result, the maps of natural vegetation covered only few parts of the world. It was not until the 1990s that satellite images had become effectively available to a broader gremium of scientists and biologists. Some of the first detailed mapping applications with remotely sensed imagery for the tropics was the pioneering work by Iremonger in 1993, 1994 and 1997. These were important advances as they facilitated much faster and more cost-effective mapping, particularly after the LANDSAT 7 imagery became available for less than US $500 per image in the year 2000. GIS software had also become more broadly available which can now be operated from regular desktop computers.The World Bank/Netherlands Government/CCAD financed the production of an ecosystem-mapping, spanning more than 1500 km from Belize to Panama: the of the Ecosystems of Central America. Ecosystems were mapped by more than 20 scientists using the Tentative Physiognomic-Ecological Classification of Plant Formations of the Earth, developed under the auspices of the UNESCO, complemented with additional aquatic ecosystems and some floristic modifiers. The term ecosystem was used, because it was argued that areas with distinct physiognomic and ecological characteristics would not only have partially distinct sets of floristic elements, but also partially distinct sets of fauna and fungi elements. It was demonstrated that ecosystems derived from such criteria could be identified in considerable detail and a short period, using satellite images and teams of experienced national biologists. This opening the way to worldwide detailed identification and localisation of ecosystems and related species assemblages. It now has become possible to distinguish and map partially distinct assemblages of species rapidly and in considerable detail.The Honduran part of that map was used to evaluate the presence and gaps of ecosystem representation in the protected areas system, SINAPH, of Honduras. An MS-Excel based spreadsheet evaluation programme called MICOSYS was used to compare the relative importance of each area and to design alternative models for protected areas system for different scenarios of conservation security and socio-economic benefits. To achieve this, very specific criteria are needed that allow differentiation of size requirements for protected areas depending on a variety of factors such as Minimum Viable Population (MVPs) and Minimum Area requirements (MARs), functionality for both terrestrial and aquatic species of animals, plants and fungi, as well as ecosystem characteristics. Several principles and a few new ideas have been integrated into a holistic approach that allows the synthesis of rational protected areas systems. Particularly, new ideas have been presented on the minimum required sizes of protected areas, in which not merely top predators were considered as limiting factors, but rather ecosystems as a whole. As far as the SLOSS (Single Large Or Several Small reserves) debate is concerned, it is clear that we will need SLASS: Several Large And Several Small reserves, the latter complementing with ecosystems absent in the large areas protected areas. The proposed method not only generates differentiation in importance of the protected areas on the basis of socio-economic and ecological factors, but it also calculates estimates of investment needs and recurrent costs. It was originally developed in 1992 for Costa Rica, but it is country-size independent and may be applied anywhere in the world. The cost calculations are of strategic importance. Governments all over the world have made great progress in institutionalising protected areas. But it was only a first necessary step. Adequate funding has not yet come along to meet the requirements. A realistic idea about costs is necessary to work toward finding solutions to the financing problem.One of the by-products of the Map of the Ecosystems of Central America is an MS-Access-based database called Protected Areas and Ecosystems Monitoring Database , for storage of ecological field information, to support physical, physiognomic and floristic information. The database has been expanded to also store information on fauna as well as essential information on the use of natural resources and visitation within an area, thus creating a tool for protected area or ecosystem monitoring. In Honduras, a monitoring approach was developed and the database had become fully integrated and made user-friendlier, so that it could also be used by park rangers.The techniques used in the methodology are all known methods that have been evaluated and tested to be integrated into an appropriate technology approach. User-friendly applications were designed in familiar programmes to be accessible to national scientists and rangers anywhere in the world.

Analyses of complex microbial communities are becoming increasingly important. Bottlenecks in these analyses, however, are the tools to actually describe the biodiversity. Novel protocols for a DNA array based analyzes of microbial communities are presented. In these protocols, the specificity obtained by sequence-specific labeling of DNA probes is combined with the possibility of detecting several different probes simultaneously by DNA array hybridization. The gene encoding 16S ribosomal RNA was chosen as the target in these analyses. This gene contains both universally conserved regions, and regions with relatively high variability. The universally conserved regions are used for PCR amplification primers, while the variable regions are used for the specific probes. Arrays prepared on positively charged nylon membranes and coated glass slides were compared. The advantage of using membranes is that chromogenic signal amplification can be used for the detection. Furthermore, the chromogenic detection does not require any sophisticated equipment. The advantage of the glass slides is that multiple fluorescence colors can be detected simultaneously, and that internal controls can be used for normalization. This approach is also suited for high throughput screenings.

chapter discusses the Camp Caiman gold project in French Guiana. Topics include the increased role of local communities and NGOs in bringing environmental problems to the attention of governments; the need of governments for clear and specific legislative commitments to environmental protection in mining and petroleum legislation and a clear legislative and administrative mandate that will lead to the selection mining an petroleum companies that have well‐established environmental protection track records and the capability to finance environmental protection.

Few would have guessed that the summit would now be viewed as the high water mark of international environmental action. There is a frightening disconnect between the growing scientific evidence of global environmental problems such as climate change, biodiversity loss, and nitrogen loading, and the rapidly diminishing political attention given to the environment. Within the industrialized world, the environmental problems of the 1960s and 1970s that spawned the environmental movement were the \"in your face\" issues of air and water pollution. They literally could not be ignored and, as a consequence, considerable progress has been made in addressing them. It is all too easy to ignore the environmental problems of today, even though they are far more threatening to the planet's life support systems. Their impacts are distant in time, while actions to address them often incur immediate costs. It is easy for us to bemoan the fact that decision makers are not acting in response to the growing scientific understanding of these problems. But in fact, decision makers didn't respond to good science in the 1960s and 1970s either – they responded to the public demand for action (which in turn was supported by science). Simply put, no matter how sound the science, action will not be taken to address global environmental threats until the public demands it and until the need is recognized by the wide range of stakeholders who will benefit and pay the costs. That is far from the case today. Ecological research findings related to these global environmental challenges reach only a small fraction of the broad array of decision makers and the public who must ultimately press for changes. Instead, all too often, we are preaching to the converted in efforts to bring science to bear on public policy. It is not enough to have reports read by Ministries of Environment when the real power over the environment lies with the Ministries of Finance and in corporate boardrooms. One international scientific effort that seeks to break through to new audiences is the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MA), launched by the Secretary General of the United Nations in 2001 and involving nearly 1000 social and natural scientists. One year from now, the MA will release a set of four technical assessment reports focused on the consequences of ecosystem change for human well-being and a series of shorter summary and synthesis reports. The MA has been designed to be relevant not just to the environment sector, but also to other public sectors, business, and industry. The basic framework that the MA utilizes is based on the concept that ecosystems provide services that are of benefit to humanity. The assessment is evaluating what these services are, how they are valued by society, and how the services are being enhanced or degraded by human actions. All of this is put in the context of examining services in a holistic manner so that tradeoffs in resource use can be fully evaluated. Then, importantly, it provides contrasting scenarios of plausible futures for ecosystem services as well as an analysis of what kinds of options we have, or could devise, to alter future trajectories to favorable outcomes. The MA has engaged a broad spectrum of users from the outset. The MA Board is a reflection of the multiple audiences, including representatives of governments, international conventions, companies, the media, NGOs, and indigenous groups. A considerable effort is also being made to ensure that its products are widely disseminated. One important outreach mechanism stems directly from the basic structure of the MA. Most decision makers concerned with the use of natural resources do not operate at the global level. As a result, in addition to its global assessment, the MA is undertaking a set of subglobal assessments within regions, nations, watersheds, and local communities. MA subglobal assessments are now underway around the world, including in southern Africa, Sweden, India, Peru, Chile and Western China, to name a few. Earth's natural resources are being compromised by human activities. We are slowly assembling the scientific information that will enable us to show stakeholders what this means for them, today and in the future. It is incumbent upon the scientific community to ensure that its findings are available to individuals who can act upon them. Increasingly, the decision makers whose actions matter are those outside of the \"traditional\" audience for ecological information. That audience won't come knocking on our doors. New mechanisms are needed to link science to this broader audience, and the MA may provide a useful model.

Chakrabarty not only helped considerably the development of the biotech industry, but also affected practices in the intellectual property area. After the rejection of the US Patent Office's claim that living organisms per se cannot be patented, companies now were able to seek a wider protection for products created using DNA recombinant technologies, while patent offices were given the opportunity to expand their activities into this area. During the 1980s, recombinant proteins were mostly developed for the treatment of pathologies such as diabetes, anemia, growth disorders and infertility. The properties of these molecules were well characterized in vivo, so patent offices were able to apply the well established principles of patent law—utility, inventiveness, novelty and unity—in a satisfactory way. The speed at which genetic information is accumulated by far exceeds the speed at which patent offices can examine applications thoroughly But in the last decade, technological advances in sequencing and bioinformatics have allowed biotech companies to identify, massively and at low cost, novel gene sequences for which they are seeking patent protection (Figure 1; Table 1). The speed at which genetic information is now accumulated and submitted to patent offices by far exceeds the speed at which genes can be even roughly characterized, and that at which patent offices can examine applications thoroughly to decide on their patentability (Figures 2 and 3).

As had been made clear in articles and discussions in journals like Nature and Science, many scientists regard this as a major deterrent to research, and hold the patent system responsible for this distortion of law practice. However, before labeling the whole patent system as faulty, the actual impact of this patenting frenzy on the activities of research laboratories should be evaluated, taking into account some of the concepts of patent law, as well as some consequences of the current situation. Apart from the basic requirements for obtaining a patent, the patent system also assigns a fundamental importance to the concept of experimental use exemption to patent infringement (Ducor, 1999). This institution stems directly from the original goal of the patent system to promote innovation by granting, in exchange for public disclosure of the invention, a time-limited exclusivity for commercial exploitation. Patent infringement takes place if a product or a method covered by a patent is produced, used, imported or sold without permission or license from the patentee. A researcher working on a patented matter to improve it cannot be sued for patent infringement as the experimental use exemption applies to his work. A researcher working on a patented matter to improve it or for non-commercial research cannot be sued for patent infringement Patent literature makes available to the public a large body of knowledge in terms of DNA/protein sequences, biological materials deposited in public collections such as the American Type Culture Collection, and experimental results, which is not always, or only later, disclosed in other form. This information is published in a format compliant with Patent Offices procedures of analysis, which are different from those of the scientific peer-reviewing system, but scientists can find and make use of relevant first-hand data for the purpose of their research. Some attention should be taken in considering the possibility that some research activities may not fall under the experimental use exemption. In non-corporate environments, it is becoming increasingly important to produce results that can lead not only to scientific publications, but also to patent applications, and thus eventually to a commercial exploitation. As has often been pointed out, licenses and royalties on products are becoming more and more important resources to finance research institutions (Mulligan and Steele, 2000). On the other hand, non-corporate research has an important role. The massive investments in the life sciences made by governments are still a driving force in generating the knowledge base for the biotech industry (Kroll et al., 1998). Therefore, suing public research institutions could be an indelicate move, damaging to the image of a company and to its relationship with the scientific community. Thus, the applicability of the experimental use exemption can become a matter of interpretation and, eventually, negotiation. An interesting situation is represented by the use of DNA microarrays as research tools. The companies that assemble and sell such products are actually facing a large problem as they may be obliged to obtain multiple licenses when using DNA sequences covered by patents. As these chips are on the market for basic research as well as for commercial purposes such as drug development, it is clear that experimental use exemption does not always apply. Therefore, the company owning the granted patent on a useful DNA sequence should get a share of the profits made by selling the chips. Such a situation can lead to potentially enormous negotiation problems, with hundreds of licenses necessary for a single type of array. Lacking a widely accepted policy on these issues, most DNA chip manufacturers immobilize only DNA sequences that are in the public domain. Evidently, this represents a limitation of the DNA chips' potential, and can hamper research efforts. This example shows clearly that uncertainties and the fragmentation of patent rights can deter research programs that are necessary to confer a real value to this knowledge. Another interesting case is represented by the trend in patenting activities related to single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). While many patents disclose alternative methods to identify SNPs, some others disclose hundreds of SNP-related probes with very limited evidence of their utility, and therefore their patentability can be questioned. Only a minority of patent applications characterize SNPs that are clearly related to a disease or a gene function. It is evident that there will be problems of dependency and license negotiations on those SNPs with commercial potential. To prevent this outcome, some pharmaceutical companies and governmental institutions formed the SNP consortium, a time-limited cooperation of academia and companies to share the results of their SNP discovery programs. The consortium makes the information available to the scientific community as a database, but it also files provisional patent applications to establish discovery dates. The applications will be relinquished afterwards to avoid dependency on the SNPs as such, once their actual effect is demonstrated. Licenses and royalities are becoming more and more important resources to finance research institutions The trend in patenting of SNPs illustrates that it is becoming more and more difficult to assess the real enforceability of patent applications based on long sequence listings. Since unity of the invention is a basic criterion for patentability, patent offices will force applicants to split the original application into several separate ones, each covering SNPs with shared features. Fees and work-hours for the applicant consequently increase during the prosecution of such patent applications—maintaining a single patent only in the major countries can cost hundreds of thousands of US dollars. It is, therefore, a more reasonable and efficient way to file applications where only SNPs with medical utility are disclosed in order to obtain really enforceable patent rights. A company must also take into account that the value of a SNP disclosed in a patent application may be dramatically affected if an alternative method becomes available for population screening. This holds true for expressed sequence tags (ESTs) as well: obtaining the protein without using the patented EST may not require a license, depending on the claim wording in the granted patent. Another aspect of this field is that public–private initiatives such as the Merck Gene Index project are promoting the unrestricted exchange of genetic data. Nowadays, patent offices and practitioners are facing major procedural and organization problems since dictionary-sized applications disclosing thousands of sequences challenge not only the criteria for granting a patent, but also established practises in examining, archiving and publishing. From the legal point of view, patent offices have to deal first with the basic rules contained in patent conventions and treaties. Even if the adaptation of the examination guidelines and the outcome of patent lawsuits—events already going on or expected to come in a few years—may have an impact on patent law, the basic criteria for granting a patent will hardly be affected. The patent community is concerned that the patent system might lose credibility if the protection offered were perceived as limiting economic advances In addition, international documents such as the agreement on Trade-Related aspects of Intellectual Property rights (TRIPs), the conventions on biodiversity and on the protection of plant varieties, as well as EC directives established general rules for the implementation of intellectual property rights. Any important or unilateral change of gene patenting policies must take into account the principles defined by these documents that were directed to harmonize patenting practices not only in different countries but also for any economic activity. There is large consensus in governments and industries on the fact that standardizing of patent policies is very important to create economic, scientific and social value around the identification of the ‘functional’ genetic information (Brown, 2000). This has become a challenge not only for companies, but also for the scientific community as a whole, given that the public and shareholders have great expectations for the development of new drugs and treatments, and do not wish to see resources wasted on endless legal battles. Many people, not only in academia but also in industry, would therefore like to see gene patenting restricted to sequences that clearly define a function or a disease (Thomas, 1999). The patent community largely agrees as it is also concerned that the patent system might lose credibility if the protection offered were perceived as limiting rather than promoting economic advance and diffusion of knowledge. The risk of ‘over-patenting’ can exist, but in most of the situations the application of existing laws can moderate most of the excesses and, in the end, help to reward real creativity by granting patent protection that is fair and sensible. The adoption of a collaborative attitude amongst the various actors when it comes to facing patenting problems would help eliminate the remaining uncertainties.

essay examines the issues of equity and efficiency in the use of global environmental resources, with the atmosphere as a case in point. It shows a somewhat unexpected connection between the two issues in the context of international greenhouse gas emissions trading markets. Contrary to common wisdom, achieving a more even distribution of property rights to environmental assets is more than a matter of equity. Property rights also influence market efficiency. I show that a precondition for market efficiency is that more property rights in the global commons should be given to those regions that own fewer private goods. This connection leads to recommendations to implement the greenhouse gas emissions trading regimes authorized by the Kyoto Protocol to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (FCCC). In order to ensure an efficient trading market, developing countries should be allocated proportionately more emissions rights than industrial countries. In addition, there is a need to create an International Bank for Environmental Settlements (IBES) as a self-financing institution that can obtain market value from environmental resources while preserving them. Emissions trading, the global reinsurance of environmental risks, and securitization of the earth's biodiversity resources are financial instruments that merge the interests of the private financial markets with international sustainable development policy. These instruments and institutions should help to redefine economic progress in a way that is compatible with a harmonious use of the world's resources and with equity among rich and poor nations.","citation":"Graciela Chichilnisky (2000)","page":"chunk_3_1"}

food situation in India is worsening day by day, mainly due to an ever increasing human population. It is difficult to increase crop productivity with the current availability of land, water resources, labour, finance and crop production technology. Among the newer technologies, the cultivation of genetically modified crops (GMCs) may help in improving food availability, nutritional quality and shelf life of harvested produce and in developing plants resistant to insect pests, disease pathogens and herbicides. However, GMCs have attracted many critics because of their potential impacts on biodiversity, toxicity to non-target organisms, cross-resistance in pests, the higher prices of seeds and foods, monopoly of companies, patent and regulatory approval, and safety to consumers. Some consider that GMCs are unwanted, unsafe and unnecessary, while others favour their introduction and use in India. The debate continues among scientists, policy makers, social activists, farmers and consumers, but this situation may change in the near future because of the impact of World Trade Organization (WTO) policies on globalization and the free market.","citation":"R.

formless, chaotic, and unwieldy talking shop, dogged by rows during the many preparatory meetings, and rigged in favour of corporate interests. Such are the advance notices for the World Summit on Sustainable Development, beginning next week in South Africa. It is easy for armchair critics to be cynical. Many of the goals of the 1992 Rio Earth Summit, set out in its action document, Agenda 21, have not been achieved. GEO-3, the recently published Global Environmental Outlook, describes increasing poverty, greater inequality, and continued political paralysis. Historically this summit comes at the most precarious moment since the end of the Cold War. Famine mixed with ruthless political violence in Southern Africa; geopolitical instability post-September 11; a threatened US war with Iraq; escalating conflict between Israelis and Palestinians; nuclear stand-off between Pakistan and India; economic collapse in Latin America; the globalisation of inequity; and successive corporate crises in the world's dominant hyperpower. The so-called new world order now feels more like the old world order, simply writ larger. Therefore the temptation to be cynical should be put to one side. The Johannesburg summit will only work with vision, optimism, and courage. In 1992, the central theme of sustainable development was the environment, following the work of Gro Harlem Brundtland—the present Director General of WHO—and her World Commission on Environment and Development. In a decade, that emphasis has broadened to include health, water, food, conflict, and energy. In this week's issue, The Lancet publishes an analysis of health's contribution to this process by the WHO's technical lead on sustainable development, Yasmin von Schirnding (p 632). What should doctors expect from Johannesburg? There are five tests that health professionals can apply. •Water and sanitation: von Schirnding identifies access to clean water as the single most important prerequisite for health and sustainable development. 2·5 billion people—over a third of the world's population—have no access to improved sanitation, and over 1·5 million children die each year from diarrhoeal disease.•Child health: If governments want to provide a healthier future for succeeding generations, two issues must be confronted—tobacco use and HIVAIDS. UNAIDS acts as an excellent focal point for advocacy, political change, and programme development. WHO's tobacco-free initiative offers similar opportunities. But while HIV-AIDS is an easy issue for politicians to ally themselves with, antitobacco policies are more difficult to embrace given that the product remains legal. Indeed, tobacco is barely mentioned in GEO-3; it needs to be taken seriously by South African summiteers.•Financing for development: Talk is necessary, but money is essential. Rich nations have failed to steer a course towards 0·7% of GNP for official development assistance. Lack of funding by these countries kills those living in poverty. This deliberate and amoral policy of neglect should be a key political issue in the western world. It is not.•Population: Presently a low priority for Johannesburg, changes in population growth and structure are having substantial impacts on health and development. As a minimum, politicians must commit to family planning programmes—a particular source of embarrassment for the US government, which recently ended its funding for such international activities—and education, especially for women, about reproductive health.•Conflict: A recent UN report concluded that countries spend over US $800 billion on weapons and other military resources—2·6% of the world's GDP. Sustainable development demands security—is spending on arms the most productive way to achieve that security? Alternative solutions need to be debated. The World Summit on Sustainable Development is not a junket. It is a vital moment to hold governments to account for their stewardship of the world's resources. The health professions have an increasingly important part to play in this debate. Their voices deserve to be heard not only in Johannesburg, but also in those countries whose governments could make a real difference to the lives of the poor. Health and sustainable development: can we rise to the challenge?The forthcoming World Summit on Sustainable Development is an unprecedented opportunity to place health higher on the environmental and development agenda. The world's leaders will be grappling with some of the major challenges of our times—how to eradicate poverty and meet the world's development needs in a way that does not destroy the environment. Topping the agenda are water, energy, health, agriculture, and biodiversity. Improvement of access of the world's poor people to clean water, sanitation, and safe sources of household energy would have a huge effect on the main killers of young children—pneumonia and diarrhoea.

main targets of the common agriculture policy aiming at sustainable development should be: increasing emphasis on fostering and maintaining sustainable development, promoting environmentally-driven high quality products, managing biodiversity and implementing environmentally-driven technologies including use of renewable raw materials. On September 22, 2006 the Polish Parliament enacted a law on using funds sourced from the European Union budget and allocated to finance the common agricultural policy. The law applies to authorities engaged in making payments financed from the European funds allocated for financing agriculture and development of rural areas, such as: Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development, Agency for Restructuring and Modernisation of Agriculture, Agricultural Market Agency as well as Customs Service and inspectorates reporting to the Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development (including the ones reporting to National Bank of Poland which handles relevant bank accounts).","citation":"Antoni Magdoń (2009)","page":"chunk_3_1"}

The monitoring, as carried out by EROS staff and their Senegalese collaborators, has involved use of information collected by remote sensing (satellite and aerial photographs) as well as extensive field work including the collection of physical information about soils, vegetation, land use practices, and biodiversity at 2 over 600 sites in all parts of the country (Tappan and Wood, 1995). This information provides a remarkable record of changes in physical and land cover parameters over the last 30 years.

wish to correct the misimpression created by David Western's letter (5 June, p. [1507][1]) regarding my views and statements about community-based conservation (CBC). Contrary to his statement, I have never called for the Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS) to stop all spending outside the parks, and I am fully aware that the Protected Area and Wildlife System (PAWS) project was not meant to support only in-park activities. In fact, my role on the World Bank's PAWS project appraisal team in 1992 was to evaluate and help shape the proposed “community wildlife” component of the program. My concern, as I explained to Michael McRae, author of the Science article (News & Comment, 24 Apr., p. 510), is that KWS is spending more than it can afford on community development activities outside parks (much of it on basic social welfare projects), with questionable conservation impacts. This has become particularly problematic as KWS is in the midst of a serious cash crisis, unable to meet its most basic recurrent costs, such as staff salaries.\n\nSimilarly, the implication that Richard Leakey was indifferent to community and “outside park” issues during his tenure is incorrect. In fact, the “Community Wildlife Program” and several of the most promising community-based projects were initiated by KWS under Leakey's leadership. While he did at one point suggest that all the parks should be fenced as a way of tackling human-wildlife conflict, this was never an “initiative” or even a serious proposal, and never became KWS policy or practice. In reality, a clear distinction has always been made between “hard-edged parks,” where fencing in the wildlife is ecologically justifiable and the only realistic solution (and where the World Bank and other donors have consequently supported it), versus “soft-edged parks” where animals must be free to disperse or migrate beyond the park boundaries.\n\nRegarding CBC more generally, Western and other commentators (Letters, 5 June, p. 1510) assert that this approach has been highly successful in Kenya and elsewhere, but offer no real evidence that this is the case. Western's statement that “[m]ore than 30 community reserves have been drawn up” (not actually established) cannot be evaluated without information about what this means in terms of specific changes in land use or other activities significant to conservation objectives. Endorsements of the CBC approach abound in the literature, but what is generally lacking, not least for CBC projects being supported by KWS, is independent data demonstrating conservation benefits being achieved by these projects, such as monitorable changes in species richness, population densities, or habitat quality. In my experience, where data do exist to show impacts such as reductions in poaching or encroachment on protected areas, it is hard to argue that these result from community development activities rather than from the improved enforcement measures that these projects also support. Social welfare projects and similar benefits can help bring people to accept and even cooperate with such measures, but the enforcement continues to be an essential element, particularly in projects involving protected areas and species. There is also the issue of sustainability, as the CBC activities supported by KWS (and many others) tend to be highly dependent on external funding, and any goodwill that has been generated by them is likely to evaporate if the funding stops. All in all, I must endorse an observation in the World Bank's forthcoming study of Integrated Conservation and Development Projects (ICDPs) in Indonesia, that is, that the ICDP/CBC concept has moved rapidly from an untested hypothesis to being regarded as “best practice,” but without having demonstrated a significant measure of success. Speaking as someone who is involved in decisions on funding for biodiversity conservation, the practical and other limitations of a purely protectionist/exclusionary approach are clear, particularly as protected areas are traditionally underfunded and many are too small to sustain critical biodiversity resources. However, the CBC approach also has its limitations, and successful conservation strategies will have to incorporate a variety of approaches\n\nFinally, I agree with Western that, contrary to our initial expectations (when the World Bank and other donors agreed to finance the PAWS program), it is unrealistic to expect KWS to be fully financially self-sufficient as long as it continues to carry out its current scope and scale of non-revenue-earning activities. Having rejected self-sufficiency as a goal, however, KWS needs to establish and pursue alternative financial targets and to prioritize its activities, given that ultimately it has no option but to operate within the limits of the funds it is able to obtain from all possible sources. Therefore, KWS needs to take a hard look at how much it should spend on each of its activities, including CBC, and what it gets in return. While there is certainly important biodiversity and critical habitat to be conserved outside the parks, park entry fees currently provide about 95% of KWS's revenues. It is a basic principle of business (and common sense) first and foremost to protect your main source of income. Not only the World Bank, but all the international donors supporting KWS, have repeatedly expressed concern over these issues and pressed KWS to come to grips with these realities.\n\nI hope that the recently designed “minimum viable conservation network” cited by Western is a positive step in that direction, although I have not yet seen any discussion of its financial implications. KWS is entrusted with the care of an enormously valuable national and international heritage. While Western claims that its current strategies and activities were developed with a high degree of consultation and participation among stakeholders countrywide, there are many important and knowledgeable stakeholders who feel otherwise and who believe that KWS is going seriously off track.\n\n [1]: /lookup/doi/10.1126/science.280.5369.1507c","citation":"Agi Kiss (1998)","page":"chunk_3_1"}

of life and living systems are a necessary condition for human development. As human use of resources, energy, and space intensified over the past few centuries, the diversity of life has been substantially diminished in most parts of the world. Conserving and restoring important components of the earth's biodiversity is our obligation to future generations. Biodiversity conservation is currently a principal goal for resource management of 11.5% of the world's surface area. However, substantial portions of non-human life occur outside of legally protected spaces. Even those that occur within reserves either move or have remnant populations outside. Maintaining connectivity between habitats, populations, and gene pools in and outside parks and reserves is vital for successful biodiversity conservation and restoration. Ecologists have proposed biological corridors, biosphere reserves, ecosystem management, and ecoregional planning as approaches to integrate biodiversity conservation and socioeconomic development at increasingly larger spatial scales. Ecosystem, species, and genetic level integrators appropriate to specific ecological, economic, political, social, and cultural contexts need to be identified, described, and tested in development planning and management. Globally, ecosystem services have gained attention as an integrator of biodiversity use and conservation that is amenable to economic valuation and could provide a basis for negotiations between conservation and development stakeholders. However, as the results of the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment showed, human societies tend to favor ecosystem services with a production bias, to the detriment of all others; three of the four services that have improved during the past 50 years are crop, livestock, and aquaculture production. The fourth service, enhanced carbon sequestration, has kindled hopes for linking emerging incentives in carbon markets and financing to biodiversity conservation and recovery. Critics claim that forest recovery leading to increased carbon sequestration has been confined to rich nations, and was possible only because the forests were previously exploited for production purposes. Climate change constraints and carbon-financing opportunities have emerged only in the past two or three decades. Voluntary initiatives in the financial sector to link land use, land-use change, and forestry with carbon sequestration and conservation, and recovery of biodiversity, must be seen as opportunities for using the best available ecological and other expert knowledge to improve the chances for biodiversity futures. Ecosystem services may also provide indirect ways to sustain species and genetic-level linkages between biodiversity in and around protected areas. Globally, humans are moving to the cities. The ethical and aesthetic implications of these human migrations are uncertain and open to debate. But abandoned lands in and around protected areas may be managed as wildlife habitats mixed with productive activities such as forestry, animal husbandry, and agriculture. Case studies and context-specific evidence of successful integration of biodiversity conservation at various levels and socioeconomic development at a range of spatial scales are urgently needed. Wide-ranging charismatic species almost always have spatial requirements that extend beyond parks and sanctuaries. They provide incentives and opportunities for planning and managing biodiversity at regional scales. In Sichuan, southwest China, forestry activities have been abandoned and provincial level plans to conserve and restore giant panda habitats are gaining acceptance among development planners. In 2002, following the Johannesburg Summit on Sustainable Development, UNEP and UNESCO launched the Great Apes Survival Project as a response to global concerns over the future of bonobos, chimpanzees, gorillas, and orangutans. The range of bonobos, for example, is restricted to selected parts of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, including forests lying outside legally protected areas. These initiatives will tell us whether it is possible to successfully integrate conservation and development practices. The other three great ape species, as well as many other species with large parts of their range outside protected areas, provide similar challenges and opportunities. Revival of commitments to conserve iconic species and populations, possibilities for influencing land-use change and forestry by linking ecosystem services and carbon financing, and compatibility between tourism and other productive sectors are opening up an era of options for integrating use and conservation of biodiversity. If these opportunities are to benefit both biodiversity and human society, ecologists must find new and constructive ways of working with development planners and decision makers. The Man and the Biosphere and other UNESCO programs for international cooperation are global platforms for trying out new ways of bringing conservation and development together.

previous chapters of this book presented a comprehensive and objective guide to the rules, institutions and procedures of the climate regime. Our main aim in doing so was to make the regime more accessible. An additional hope was to encourage an informed assessment of the merits of what has been achieved, as well of the limitations that remain. We realise that few policy-makers have the time to reflect deeply on the overall direction of climate rules and the ‘health’ of climate institutions to see if these are performing at their best. Increased specialisation, policy linkages and travel commitments, on top of the demands of deepening domestic implementation processes, all take a toll. And, of course, climate change is not the only global challenge. Eradicating poverty, funding AIDS research, creating financial stability, progressing gender equality, financing biodiversity conservation, and securing peace and security, to name a few, compete for resources and time, notwithstanding the vital contribution each makes to achieving sustainable development and the Millennium Development Goals which climate change itself now potentially threatens.","citation":"Farhana Yamin & Joanna Depledge (2004)","page":"chunk_3_1"}

establishment by the 1990 amendments to the 1987 Montreal Protocol of a financial mechanism to address ozone depletion marked an important turning point in international environmental law. In the subsequent decade the rules on finance and technology transfer have developed significantly and substantively, together with legislative and judicial consideration of the relationship between intellectual property rights and environmental protection. This has occurred notwithstanding the early concerns of some industrialised countries that the establishment of the Montreal Fund would adversely prejudice future developments. Financial resources, technology transfer and intellectual property were central issues at UNCED and of the two treaties signed at UNCED. As described in this chapter, the 1992 Climate Change and Biodiversity Conventions – as well as subsequent instruments on drought and desertification (1994), climate change (1997), biosafety (2000) and persistent organic pollutants (2001) have further elaborated the principles established under the Montreal Protocol and its amendments. Related developments – particularly in the context of the activities of the multilateral development banks, the WTO Agreement on Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPs), the European Patent Convention, and the 2001 International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture – have added to the broadening range of legal issues which are touched by, and increasingly integrated with, international environmental concerns.","citation":"Philippe Sands (2003)","page":"chunk_3_1"}

ecological network Natura 2000 is one element of the common European Union policy regarding biodiversity protection. National implementation of Natura 2000 differs across the European Union. Ecologically valuable forest ecosystems are often within private lands. The aim of this paper is to assess the implementation of the compensation mechanism developed through adapted management of private forests by using the Natura 2000 payments’ measure of the European rural development programmes for the financing period 2007–2014. The econometric Heckman selection model was used to assess the drivers influencing the implementation of the payments measure. Data sources include European and national statistics and expert knowledge. The results show that the countries with the highest proportion of forest cover in Natura 2000 protected areas are the least paid for compensation, and the implementation apparently does not follow the needs of private forests (assuming from the share of private forests in the country). The state of progress in designating Natura 2000 sites can be an important driver for increasing the probability of Natura 2000 payments for those countries accessing the European Union after 1995. Other evidence includes that national economic development is not observed to be significant in explaining the implementation of Natura 2000 payments. The drivers affecting the implementation of Natura 2000 payments are more focused on increasing the competitiveness of the forest sector than supporting environmental sustainability.","citation":"Joseph A.

environmental opportunities for the finance sector, which include: environmental investment funds; investment in new environmental technologies and services; and brokering tradeable environmental rights. The rapidly‐growing market in environmental technology and services is currently around $0.5 trillion globally, largely in waste management, and 60 per cent in Europe and North America. Argues that brokerage opportunities are currently limited but could expand quickly to trillion‐dollar totals if international climatechange and biodiversity agreements come into effect. Warns that environmental risks for the finance sector derive largely from the transfer of clean‐up liabilities to lenders and insurers, although this varies greatly between nations. Clean‐up costs may reach $2 billion for a single site.","citation":"Ralf Buckley (1992)","page":"chunk_3_1"}

primary aim of the Convention on Biological Diversity is to encourage and enable all countries to conserve biodiversity and to use its components sustainably in support of national development.Biodiversity means the diversity of living organisms, including diversity of species and ecosystems.Two very important attributes of biodiversity are species richness (the number of species in an area) and endemism (the number of species in that area which occur nowhere else).More information is available at a global level on these attributes than on other aspects of biodiversity.Because they reflect the complexity, uniqueness and intactness of natural ecosystems, they indicate overall concentrations of biodiversity in a useful way.Current knowledge of country level species richness and endemism for mammals, birds and higher plants is generally adequate for some decision-making purposes.However, information on other taxonomic groups is far less complete, and knowledge of richness and endemism for such groups is poor.It is also known that biodiversity is not evenly distributed in the world.Some areas are much richer in species and endemics than others.Broad geographical differences between groups of countries also exist.The tropical countries lying between the Indian and the Pacific Oceans, and the countries of northern South America and Central America are particularly rich in species and endemics.A number of important actions which countries can take to implement the Convention and maintain their biodiversity can be readily identified.However, there is a need for the Conference of the Parties to adopt specific priorities for immediate action, which should reflect, inter alia, the global distribution of biodiversity and the threats to it.Prevailing scientific opinion is that the next few decades will be a period of maximum danger for the diversity of species and ecosystems around the world.It is not possible to know the precise number of species which are becoming extinct or are likely to do so, but some projections suggest that at least 10 and possibly 40 per cent of the world's present species are likely to be extinct within 50 years.By acting now, the world community can help to minimise the eventual scale of species losses.This can best be achieved by managing communities of organisms in the wild, using on-site (in situ) measures.Major immediate priorities should be:a) to strengthen the management of ecosystems and habitats containing a disproportionately large share of the world's terrestrial and marine biodiversity, b) to help developing countries to complete national biodiversity strategies and action plans, to initiate procedures to monitor their own biodiversity, and to take steps to establish and maintain adequate national systems of conservation areas, c) to support actions at the global level, providing benefit to all countries in managing their own biodiversity.The choice of sites for priority action should be made using a variety of criteria.Generally, resources will best be spent in safeguarding ecosystems and habitats that are both viable and important for global biodiversity, and which are threatened by factors that can be controlled cost-effectively.It is proposed that on the basis of these criteria, and using the best available information on the global ee ee ee eeThe financing mechanism of the Convention should also support actions at the global level, including: firstly, promoting coordination among the agencies which implement existing international agreements; secondly, promoting sharing of experience from conservation projects between nations and agencies; and thirdly, managing global information to provide effective services for the exchange and repatriation of scientific data, and for monitoring the status of biodiversity and providing early warning of threats to its components.The framework for the global early warning system should be a comprehensive and regularly updated global inventory of those ecosystems and habitats, species and communities, and genomes and genes described in Annex I of the Convention.Such an inventory and early warning system will provide a vital part of the information needed to identify future global priorities for action.Among the many possible responses, there are ten important actions that countries can take to implement the Convention (WRI, 1994):e In response to Article 6: develop national plans, strategies, and/or policies to improve the capacity to conserve biodiversity and to use its components sustainably.e In response to Article 7: identify important components of biodiversity (ie.ecosystems, species, lineages, etc.), conduct biodiversity inventories and surveys, identify activities that adversely affect biodiversity, and develop a system for organizing and maintaining this information so that it may be acted upon.e In response to Article 8: (a) establish or strengthen networks of national protected areas in order to protect species, habitats, representative ecosystems and genetic variability within species; (b) control, eradicate or prevent the introduction of alien species that threaten ecosystems, habitats or indigenous species; and (c) develop or maintain necessary legislation, institutional capacities and other provisions for the protection of threatened species and populations.© In response to Articles 8, 10 and 11; manage and use biological resources sustainably outside protected areas, including degraded ecosystems, and adopt economic and social incentives to that end.e In response to Article 9: establish and/or strengthen facilities for the off-site (ex-situ) conservation of biodiversity that support and complement on-site (in-situ) conservation efforts.","citation":"Mike Maunder et al.
