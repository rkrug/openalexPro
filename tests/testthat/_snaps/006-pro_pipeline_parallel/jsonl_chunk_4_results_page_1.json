western states are experiencing increasing water supply challenges, and the continuing drought makes these pressures more acute … Chronic water shortages, explosive population growth, over-allocated watersheds, environmental needs and aging water facilities are combining to create the potential for crisis and conflict over water… Being proactive is the best approach to prevent water conflicts… Interior Secretary Dirk Kempthorne The major human-environment issue in America's arid and semi-arid Southwest region is urban growth. Arid region growth is a phenomena that extends beyond the U.S., but the American case is interesting, in that it is an extreme scenario, and the politics regarding water are notably multi-scale, multi-state, multi-agency, and vitriolic in the region. In fact, Las Vegas is the most rapidly growing metropolitan area in the nation, and the Lower Colorado River Basin includes two other areas that are also in the top ten in terms of growth rate – the Phoenix, and the San Bernardino-Riverside areas. Furthermore, the U.S. Census Bureau projects that the states of Nevada and Arizona will lead the nation in terms of rates of population growth between 2005 and 2010, while California, with southern parts of the state receiving Lower Colorado River Basin water, will lead the U.S. in total population increase. “Drought” has been omnipresent in the hydropolitics of the region in recent years, but when persons see boat slips hanging in the air over where Lake Mead used to be, and the lake is below 50 percent capacity, the question now often raised by locals, scientists, and reporters traveling internationally to cover the issue is, “is this drought or climate change?” The expansion of urban areas within semi-arid and arid locations in the Lower Colorado River Basin has stressed local ecosystems and threatens adjoining, and even remote, ecosystems from which water may be transferred (Briggs and Cornelius 1998, Rowell et al. 2005). For example, in rural Nevada, the Southern Nevada Water Authority wishes to withdraw water from fragile ecosystems that ranchers have traditionally used. This is in order to feed the growth in water demand in Las Vegas and surrounding areas. Deacon et al. (2007) provide a sobering article on the past extinctions of springs in Southern Nevada due to over-development. He also challenges the development of rural water, primarily on the basis of impacts on fragile desert ecosystems. Deacon is best known for his ground-breaking work on the desert pup fish, a highly endangered relic species of fish living in the top of aquifers in the region. The extreme climatic conditions of such desert cities provides remarkable challenges to planning for development and resource management that sustains people and ecological systems over generations (i.e. sustainability). This region has never been capable of supporting permanent high-density populations in the past, and only the birth of specialized high-technology has the ability to shift this paradigm. In this region, like much of the industrialized and wealthy world, the main water concerns focus on water quantity, especially during drought, whereas in less-wealthy parts of the world the focus is on quality (Smith Jr. 2009, 2008a, 2008b, 2006). Notably, the top 21 U.S. cities with the highest average July temperatures are in Nevada and Arizona. Moreover, current global climate model simulations for the 21st century are unanimous in projecting increased temperatures in the region in the coming decades, driving increased evaporation rates. The ensemble-mean projection of the models also indicates stable to modestly decreasing precipitation rates (Dettinger 2005). These increases in evaporation and potentially small decreases in precipitation portend an ominous tilt in the rapidly-growing region's hydrologic balance toward drier conditions.11 This is presently being monitored, modeled and “stepped-down” to be run in hydrologic and other models by the team working on the 5-year NSF-funded project titled “Nevada Infrastructure for Climate Change Science, Education, and Outreach”– of which the author is the policy and outreach component lead). This is compounded by an increasing awareness that the Lower Colorado River Basin is over-allocated (Piechota et al. 2004). Nevertheless, preliminary research indicates that residential conservation of water is, at best, uneven in the basin and, in many cases, water rates are not even oriented toward conservation (i.e. inclining blocks as in Figure 1). There is a traditional over-reliance on supply-side approaches indicative of the national and international condition, and cross-state, or basin-based, collection of demand-side data and drought policy information is lacking. Conceptual model of the major types of water rates that encourage or discourage waste through market signals or the lack thereof. With such burgeoning development in arid lands over the next decades, it will be of prime importance to investigate the impact that the presence or dearth of conservation rates and technologies will have on meeting future water demand, regional capacity to cope with drought, and to balance the needs of human and ecological systems. All this will occur in the political milieu that is created when millions of people rapidly move to deserts without the local water supply normally necessary to support them. I speculate based on the play for water that the Southern Nevada Water Authority is making on rural water supplies, that in such a case the economic imperative spells trouble for the politically and economically weak. The sociopolitical dimensions of this scenario beg attention as much as do the strictly biophysical. The unusual, even odd, range of possibilities being uploaded to the public sphere to bring water to Southern Nevada underscores the bind that the region is in. More tame ideas to come to the forefront have included no placement of grass lawns when new homes are built, and heavy promotion of xeriscape principles (i.e. use of plants with extremely low water demand). Due to Nevada receiving return flow credits, outdoor conservation is inherently of greater importance than indoor conservation, since water treated and returned to the Colorado River results in credit. The more radical supply-side approaches suggested by the Southern Nevada Water Authority include drawing water from the Mississippi River, desalinization of ocean water from either Mexico or California, and cloud seeding in an already arid basin (already happening in Wyoming in an attempt to gain Nevada credits for more water). Such approaches are attractive because they allow Southern Nevada to have limitless development “cake” and eat it too. However, cloud seeding ignores the fact that that water was on its way to another ecosystem, and introduces yet even more uncertainty in an era of what is already worrisome climate change. Water from the Mississippi, like that from the Pacific Ocean, would require navigation of a labyrinth of physical and legal barriers, and possibly introduce invasive species. And piping water from far away would require notable energy production which results in greenhouse gas production. There are also serious terrorism concerns with such great exposure. And, given the current economic downturn, gathering capital for financing such endeavors may be challenging. Furthermore, it seems unlikely that California would want to swap its Colorado River water rights for local desalinated water paid by Nevada, and building facilities on the coast would be a political nightmare (thus, the Mexico option). However, the main point here is that all these ideas are intended to erase barriers to limitless growth in the desert – as if any other possibility is sacrilege. But as long as this remains a local government issue, all actors are likely to push for these types of “solutions” due to their vested interest in growth, not sustainability per se. The public sometimes seems to think that the role of purveyors such as the Southern Nevada Water Authority is sustainability, but the core objective is actually to get more water, and seemingly, control enough of the public sphere to prevent backlash. Organizations such as this can accrue so much clout, money, and leverage that they can actually seem like they are the government, and it is easy to assume a balanced agenda which may not exist. Moreover, it has not been shown that non-monetary values and environmental justice for rural communities could be integrated into market-based systems. The conundrum of increasing demand and development in an environment that is becoming more arid, and the plight of rural citizens as they attempt to maintain traditional access to water in the face of urban physical demand and economic and political might is not specific only to Nevada. For example, it is well known that near Beijing, China farmers are struggling as the water table drops below their level of accessibility, and there is even speculation on the potential need to move the capital. It is also known that the South-North Water Transfer Project is focusing on reversing the flow of water draining south to feed the demands of the north. Focusing again on the American Southwest, in such scenarios, the ability to make, revisit, and abide by agreements, and to avoid conflicts, is strained by the highly dynamic nature of populations, climate change, and the capacity of high technology to serve economic agendas. In such scenarios it is easy to see how voices for both rural, and especially, ecosystem water needs, are not often expressed in this fragile environment, despite, or to take a cynical perspective, because of, burgeoning urban water demand.22 For models balancing human demand, supply, ecological demand, equity for low income customers, revenue neutrality, and efficiency during drought using demand-side methods, please see Smith Jr. and Wang 2007, and for step-by-step detail see Wang et al. 2005. Ironically, there is a sort of cyclical nature to all of this, as when millions of people move to an area that has 125° F temperatures for a significant time of the year, many of those persons are likely to have their air conditioning on 24 hours a day for months. This is the antithesis of “designing with nature.” This kind of industrial-scale energy consumption is what brought us to the climate change conundrum, and which is going to make future water demand more difficult to meet! Clearly, traditional approaches to water resources analysis will not suffice in such a dynamic setting. From a researcher's perspective, this should provide fascinating and socially and ecologically significant opportunities to investigate possible future scenarios in multidisciplinary teams. Figure 2 illustrates dynamic connections among what might first appear to be discrete systems (and disciplines) in the Lower Colorado River Basin at various temporal and spatial scales. The model foci represent real world elements of a complex, coupled and inadequately understood set of processes impacting the health of human and natural systems in a manner that can only be understood through an interdisciplinary approach. Climate models that can be scaled to the size of the basin generally agree with each other for the next 20-30 years, which happens to match the temporal span of this manuscript. Thus, I set the modeling time frame to examine scenarios up to 20 years from now. Dynamic interplay of human and biophysical factors regarding water and climate change in the Lower Colorado River Basin and its subsystems. From left-to-right in Figure 2, there is an expected link between climate and flow in the Lower Colorado River Basin and river flow is also a source of atmospheric moisture (its impact debatable). Flow impacts the amount of water available for residential demand, and demand, of course, impacts the amount of flow at specific points in the system. Residential demand has the additional impact of altering the flow available for ecological systems and, if such policies as minimum flow standards or flows regulated by the Endangered Species Act are in place, then eco-logical systems, in turn, can impact the amount of water humans can draw from the physical system. The water made available to both people and nature has direct impacts for economic sustainability, as many economic activities, such as the silicon industry being wooed by Las Vegas, require water. Working down and back to the left in the figure, it is true that limits to water availability can impact growth potential (perhaps providing grounds for massive cross-basin transfers of water) and, at the same time, urban growth impacts demand. Demographic change in the next 20 years, both in terms of total numbers of people and composition (elasticity of demand varies by income level and other factors), will in return, drive both residential water demand and changes in land use and land cover. In addition, people move to, and build in, places in part due to their perceptions of climate and resource availability. Those perceptions may be plastic, but the extent to which people's related preferences and perceptions change over time in extremely arid environments is poorly understood. Nonetheless, climate regimes impact development. Conversely, alterations on the surface of the Lower Colorado River Basin that will occur with large demographic shifts can be modeled using a GIS and thus provide inputs to atmospheric models to examine potential impacts on local climate – bringing the reader back to the starting point in the figure. Discovering ways to make the dynamic relationship between these elements clear will advance characterization of the flows of dynamic and multidimensional changes in physical and human systems to occur in the rapidly evolving Lower Colorado River Basin over the next 20 years. In addition to the balance between these elements and the magnitude of their relationships with one another, it is fertile ground to investigate the gestalt effect of these changes on the continued viability of regional development as a whole, and the appropriate level and character of governance from the local to federal scales. Many related questions, such as how effective local regulation can be when it seems everyone in places such as Las Vegas has a vested interest in the continuation of massive growth, go beyond water per se, but deserve intellectual treatment beyond the local public sphere which is highly biased. A concern is that vulnerability in the aforementioned complex set of interacting human and natural systems will be enhanced by an imbalance caused by extreme development. Imbalance, for example, can be framed in terms of growth, or as change in level of water use by a human or ecological system that leaves inadequate water for the sustenance of the other system(s). Or, an alternative perspective on vulnerability is that there are as of yet unknown “tipping points” for the elements in Figure 2, beyond which the system cannot supply water resources to people and ecosystems without significant changes in behavior. Behavior could be changed to an as-of-now untested degree during periods of extreme water scarcity through regional application of drought demand rates, though the question of what is drought, and what is climate change, matters, as it seems as if the impact of drought demand rates is not infinite, given that water is essential and still relatively cheap. What would be worthwhile would be to project population growth, water demand, and potential for implementation of drought demand rates for the next 20 years under several plausible scenarios of climate, recharge, elasticity, growth, and allocations, and include to the degree feasible scenarios of conservation technology and landscapes (e.g. xeriscaping, land retirement, turf removal). Then use the results of these analyses to answer, better yet, visualize, perhaps geovisualize, questions that include the following: Under what conditions and when might the system become incapable of delivering adequate water? To what extent might growth impact water availability and sustainability through both demand and climate change? What role can water conservation-oriented rates, conservation landscaping and technology implementation play in buoying the systems through times of predicted greatest water scarcity…and what is the reasonable limit as to how far this might stretch viability given that growth has no cap in the U.S.? It is tradition that industrialized societies recognize maximization of capture and use (not necessarily wise-use) of resources, and increase in scale of physical development on a landscape, as indicators of progress (“conquering” nature). But is there a more healthy way to frame arid and semi-arid urban development in terms of the aforementioned relationships? A reexamination of these relationships seems wise, and the purpose of any such reexamination should be to seek harmony between the systems manifest in Figure 2, providing an opportunity for sustainability and avoidance of damaging feedbacks for humans and nature in extreme conditions for present and future generations. And, in the process of pursuing such knowledge, it is important to inquire as to how certain we can be of our findings, and what information would decrease uncertainty and risk. These aforementioned questions will require integration of our knowledge across the disciplines – and require us to extend beyond our comfort level for true collaboration and synthesis beyond the traditional water resources scope. Finally, this leads me to consider the role of geographers, as well as those in environmental studies, and others who claim that their strength is in their multidisciplinary grounding, team approach and breadth of their skill-sets. The next 20 years in arid lands such as the Lower Colorado River Basin will provide an ample platform for them to prove their worth in this highly dynamic area requiring greater multidisciplinary treatment. Advancing this argument further, if researchers are willing to concentrate on problem-centered approaches to delineating and attacking research questions and problems, rather than staying within and defending encroachment on their disciplinary silos, then multidisciplinary teams can be configured to advance praxis in scenarios such as that detailed above. A problem-centered approach is the best hope for allowing researchers to be strong in their area, and to avoid inefficient turf battles by allowing persons to focus on their own specialty areas, while allowing the blend of contributions to produce an effective gestalt-effect where there is shared intellectual ground. University administration, however, must produce internal systems that reward this type of “behavior,” and the resulting collaborative grant writing and publications that may fall out of the scope of traditional approaches. Systems that only reward single or first author publishing in a narrow scope of journals will retard advancement of the type of multidimensional research framed in Figure 2. In this case, advancements in knowledge will happen in a highly uneven manner between subareas, with significant data hoarding, and sub-boundaries between applications (i.e. studies of recharge that do not connect to demand to evaluate overall water sustainability). The internal rules to the academic game must be set to allow the creative energies of researchers, and synergies between them, to rise to meet the complexity of the highly dynamic settings of places such as the Lower Colorado River Basin. In that sense, the barriers to advancing water resources through a sustainability framework may be as much internal as external – with mitigating internal challenges to forming multidisciplinary teams arguably being a prerequisite to a “vibrant research agenda” in places such as the Lower Colorado River Basin. This seems to be especially true if researchers also endeavor for their pursuit of emerging research agendas to make a positive impact on the ground, as well as in the literature. William J.

risk management is an important part of life in the Netherlands. The Netherlands is formed by the deltas of three rivers- the Scheldt (rain-fed, originating in southern Belgium), the Meuse (rain-fed, originating in northern France), and the Rhine (glacier and rain-fed, originating in Switzerland). The country also borders the North Sea, with the Scheldt River connecting the sea to Antwerp Harbor. The Rhine is the largest of the three rivers, splitting into three branches (the Ijssel, the Lek, and the Waal) as it crosses the border into the Netherlands (Tol et al. 2003). Two-thirds of the country lies below mean sea level (Voortman 2003). The Dutch have a long history of attempting to control floods. As early as the ninth century, the Dutch started building dikes to protect reclaimed bog land (Kaijser 2002). These dikes started as local, individually-owned structures, but communities soon realized that closed dike rings were necessary to protect all sides of the region. These dike rings eventually became waterschaps or \"waterships,\" regional districts charged with water management including drainage and dike building. These districts are still the administrative body for flood defense (Linsten 2002, Voortman 2003). The 14th century saw the first major recorded floods in 1313 and 1315, leading to the famine from 1314-1317 that killed 5-10 percent of the population. Periodic flooding continued through much of the Netherlands' history. As sediment settled between the dikes, dikes grew taller. During the 19th century, reorganization of the water districts occurred and a national body was formed. Military engineers took over the construction and maintenance of the dike system (Tol and Langen 2000). During the 20th century, as trained engineers and the central government took over flood control efforts, the analysis of appropriate techniques and construction increased (Disco and van dev Ende 2003). Prior to 1953 dikes were built to the height of the previously known high-water level plus a margin of safety (Jonkman et al. 2004). Following the catastrophic flood of 1953, the Delta Committee was formed to advise the government regarding flood control (Voortman 2003). One recommendation of the Committee was to establish an optimal exceedance frequency of the design water level based on risk of flooding and cost of protection. Van Dantzig's 1956 paper described this risk-based calculation. He proposed that flood management required integration of three areas with noted problems: statistics, hydrology, and economics. In the past 50 years, significant effort has been devoted to expanding on van Dantzig's work and working on solutions to the problems he noted and the assumptions he made. Increased computing power, additional rainfall and hydrologic data, and watershed models have all added to the understanding of flooding while increased emergency preparedness and response have enhanced protection of land, homes, farms, businesses, and lives. Northern California also has a history of devastating floods, although the history of floods and water management is much shorter than in the Netherlands. Throughout the past century and a half, winter rains and snowmelt have resulted in flood events that have caused billions of dollars in damage and multiple deaths. One of the largest floods in California history occurred in January, 1862 following four weeks of rain. No quantitative flows are known, but the banks of the Sacramento were breached and the water was, at minimum, three feet deep from Sutter's Fort to Davis (Harding 1960). This flood also brought significant mining debris, covering the land near Marysville with one to six feet of sediment. During the second half of the 19th century, mining techniques had developed from ditch and flume operations to high powered hydraulic techniques that discharged up to a million gallons an hour from a single nozzle (Kelley 1989, Larson 1996). Over 1.5 billion cubic yards of sediment was discharged into the Feather, Yuba, Bear and American River basins from hydraulic mines (Larson 1996). However, the litigation between Woodruff and North Bloomfield Gravel Mining Company (1884) effectively stopped hydraulic mining by requiring complete containment of debris. Early in the settlement of California, flood control was typically very local, with levees built by individuals or local governments. Following this major flood in 1862 and the resulting litigation, hydraulic mining ended and levee management moved to larger regional agencies and the state government. The largest recorded flows in the Sacramento River were reached during the flood of March 1907. Although some tributaries have since exceeded their 1907 flows, the Sacramento River has not exceeded its peak flow of about 600,000 cubic feet per second (16,990 m3/s) (Harding 1960). Thirty to forty inches of precipitation across Northern California during the week before Christmas in 1955 led to severe damages and levee failures. Seventy-four lives were lost and over $200 million in economic losses were attributed to the flood (Harding 1960). Record rainfalls led to major flooding in 1986. Levee breaks in the Sacramento River Basin led to 13 deaths and over $400 million in damages. Two of the most expensive floods in California's history (1995 and 1997) occurred within two years of each other and together caused nearly $4 billion in damages (Department of Water Resources website). Early in California's history, no state or federal agencies managed flood control; flood control projects were managed locally. As settlement increased, however, state and federal funding and regional management became necessary. First, state and county agencies began acting to prevent flooding and then in 1917, federal authority for flood management was granted by Congress. Since then, there has been a fluctuating balance of power between regional and district, state, and federal flood control planning, funding, and management (Kelley 1989). Six types of actions can be considered for flood management (Hoojier et al. 2004): Actions to prevent flood generation: land use management in the upstream basin, Actions to modify flood flows and elevations: flood storage, levees, by-passes, and channel improvements, Flood damage reduction actions: floodplain zoning, building codes, awareness raising, Preparatory actions: flood forecasting, warning and emergency plans, Flood event actions: crisis management, evacuation, and Post-flooding actions: aftercare, financial compensation, insurance. The Dutch concentrated mostly on preventive flood control measures, and many of the measures implemented in California were first tested by the Dutch in their attempt to control flood waters. Some more recent Dutch innovations might increase California's ability to reduce flood damage. This paper is organized into three subjects. First is a review of Dutch flood control innovations. Next, implementation of each measure is discussed in California's context. The final section wraps up the discussion with a summary of key points and conclusions. Dutch flood defenses have three components: dunes, dikes, and special structures. Natural sea dunes protect coastal areas from tides and storm surges. The dunes are planted with helm grasses to hinder erosion. Where there are no dunes, the Dutch built dikes. The dikes, initially constructed along the river, have become dike rings to provide protection on all sides. The 1500 mile dike system in the Netherlands includes some massive engineering and construction accomplishments. The Afsluitdijk dike, for example, prevents North Sea intrusion into the Zuiderzee and has created the IJsselmeer freshwater lake. The dike is over 90 m wide and 32 km long. Cross dikes are used to protect against upstream dike bursts. An early example was constructed between the Lek and Linge rivers in 1284. Although this crossdike offered protection to those downstream, it increased the damage upstream (Tol and Langen 2000). Special structures include the Maeslankering storm surge barrier that closes to protect Rotterdam and surrounding towns from flooding from abnormally large storm surges. Each of the two barrier \"arms\" is as tall as the Eiffel Tower if placed upright (Sayler 2006). Other special structures include cofferdams, gates, and retaining walls. In general, these special structures are in place as temporary solutions in response to a flood event or storm surge. Flood management policies and system designs are established to reduce flood damages. Engineers today use two strategies to evaluate flood management solutions: risk-based and reliability-based design. These design strategies are described below (Hoes and Schuurmans 2006, Vrijling et al. 1997, 2005, Yanmaz 2000). Risk-based design focuses on minimizing the future costs of flooding by taking preventative measures today. Risk has two components - the chance an event will occur and the consequences of that event (Sayers et al. 2002). A subset of cost-benefit analysis, the optimal risk-based design results in the minimum total cost, from summing all costs multiplied by their probabilities for each alternative, and choosing the least expensive alternative. Risk-based design requires having a pre-established flood probability distribution, as well as reliable estimation of the damages from different flood levels. A discount rate is applied to future costs to give a net present value for evaluating different protection levels. A benefit of the risk-based approach is that it allows choices based on comparison of expected outcomes and costs of solution alternatives (Sayers et al. 2002, Hall et al. 2003, Vis et al. 2003). Reliability-based design is based on a pre-established \"acceptable\" failure probability target. Legislation, insurance policies, or other parties may determine an acceptable failure probability based on different preferences regarding loss of life, infrastructure investment, or economic loss. Acceptable failure levels may be based on the previously discussed risk-based design using the failure rate with the best net present value for the flood protection system and probable damage during flood events. Reliability-based design allows engineers and planners to develop a solution set of alternatives that provide the target level of protection and then choose the lowest-cost alternative. Flood protection systems can incorporate both methods. For example, risk-based design requires substantial data for a given floodplain. By evaluating just one section of that region with risk-based design, a target failure probability can be established and applied in a reliability-based approach to the entire region, provided other parts of the region have similar flood hydrologies, costs, flood damages, and benefits. Currently the Dutch use a minimum acceptable flooding probability for flood protection. The reliability-based design standard is based on an economic optimal value, or risk-based evaluation. The safety standard for a dike ring protecting a heavily populated city and its suburbs is higher than the standard for a dike ring protecting agricultural land. This integrated method results in the reliability design standards summarized in Figure 1. Dike Ring Reliability Standards (Staatsblad 1995). Evaluation of risk- and reliability-based designs considers the two factors of flood risk: the frequency of flooding and the consequences of flooding. Resistance strategies are designed to reduce flood risk by reducing the frequency and magnitude of flood events. Historically, these are the most common and include dike or levee systems, and reservoirs and dams. Vis et al. 2003, list the following disadvantages to resistance strategies: design discharge is constant, resulting in the assumption that all areas and land use types have equal probability of flooding, inaccurate projections of economic development occur when a resistance strategy was designed decades ago, and continual maintenance and improvements reduce environmental habitat and spoil landscape qualities. Resilience strategies focus on minimizing the consequences of a flood. These strategies include allocating land as floodplains, developing better emergency response systems, and expediting flood clean-up and recovery. Often resilience strategies are described as ways of \"living with the flood\" instead of \"fighting floods\" (Vis et al. 2003). One disadvantage of resilience strategies is de-valuation of land due to rezoning for uses compatible with flooding. In the 1950s, van Dantzig (1956) and the Delta Committee focused on three areas of flood management: statistics, hydrology and hydraulics, and economics. Van Dantzig's approach involved risk-based design for a (mostly) resistance strategy. He was the first to approach flood defense design using probability-based quantitative cost-benefit analysis (Voortman 2003). In evaluating the economic decision, van Dantzig made several assumptions: Critical dike height refers to the height at which the dike may break, but only describes the relationship between this height (H) and crown height (Hc) as H < = Hc, Dikes only fail by overtopping, Dike breaks are repaired immediately, Value of goods is stable in time relative to estimated national growth, Probability distribution of reaching critical dike height is stable in time once corrected for sinking dikes (no climate change), Value of ecological habitat (and other non-economic entities) is neglected, and Emergency response and evacuation capabilities are perfect with regards to human life. Figure 2 illustrates van Dantzig's basic approach. The horizontal axis is the project size, or level of protection, and the vertical axis is the annualized cost of the project. The dotted line is the annualized installation cost which is the sum of annualized construction and maintenance costs; as the level of protection increases, so do these costs. The dashed line is the annual expected damage cost – as the level of protection increases, these costs decrease. The solid line is the total cost line and which is the sum of the two types of costs. The optimal risk-based design is the level of protection corresponding to the least total cost, or the lowest point on the curve. Example of Risk-Based Design. Within the Dutch river districts, the importance of preserving natural and cultural lands has historically received varying attention. In 1993, however, landscape, natural, and cultural-historical values were incorporated into national Dutch policy on dike improvements (Walker et al. 1994, Lenders et al. 1999). Since then, each river district has varyingly integrated these values into their dike reinforcement plans. Environmental Impact Assessments are compulsory for projects that are not classified as immediate and urgent (Lenders et al. 1999). Participation by local citizens and environmental groups is also encouraged. Van Dantzig ignored the value of human life in his calculations for economic optimization. Nathwani et al. (1997) developed the Life Quality Index as a measure of the economic benefits of life expectancy. Voortman et al. (2002) used this to create the Extended Life Quality Index for evaluating flood protection decisions and for allowing human life to be included in mathematical and economic calculations for flood defense systems. However, the Extended Life Quality Index may be less important to total flood damage estimates when emergency alert and evacuation systems are included in flood defense measures. Currently, flood forecasting along the Rhine allows 2 to 3 days for evacuation and along the Muese forecasting is between 12 to 36 hours ahead of flooding (Hooijer et al. 2004). Uncertainty can contribute to flood management calculations in two ways – estimation of flood probability and estimating flood damages. Flood frequency estimates require knowing the probability and associated uncertainty of 1) hydraulic and hydrologic conditions, 2) failure modes of flood defense infrastructure, and 3) infrastructure failure and flood wave propagation (Kortenhaus and Oumeraci 2001). Expected damage is a function of economic development and hazard warning and preparedness (Sayers et al. 2002). Hydrologic uncertainty is often due to lack of sufficient data for estimating flood frequency curves (Yue et al. 2002, Van Noortwijk 2004). Five statistical distributions are commonly used for flood frequency analysis: Generalized Extreme Value, Gumbel, Lognormal, Weibull, and the Pearson-III (Singh and Strupczewski 2002, Apel et al. 2004). Using 35 years of data from the Rhine and Cologne Rivers, Apel et al. showed that the selection of distribution led to large variability (25 percent of maximum flood flow) in the estimate of the 150-year flood. Failure of the dike system can be estimated based on failure mode. Voortman et al. (2002) list failure modes as internal erosion, breaching through inner slope via wave overtopping, overflowing, or uplifting inner revetment, and breaching through outer slope via failure of pitched block revetment. Each failure mode can be assigned a probability of failure. The combination of all failure modes can be used to estimate the overall probability of failure (Voortman 2003). Once the defense system fails, flood wave propagation is important for estimating the extent of flood damage. Flood wave propagation can be a factor of the failure mechanism, the extent or length of original dike failure, and the characteristics of the flood hydrograph (Kortenhaus and Oumeraci 2001). Uncertainty can be reduced as better models for flood wave propagation are developed and the interactions of these factors are better understood. As these different types of uncertainty are reduced through better models, more data, or further study, flood risk and damage calculations will improve. This will enable engineers and planners to more precisely evaluate flood protection systems and design alternatives. Cost-benefit analysis requires economic quanti-fication of all costs and consequences for a flood defense design (Schmandt et al. 1988, USWRC 1962). Because not all costs are easily defined in monetary terms, the bias of the decision-maker can be reflected in the analysis. Risk-prone decision making results in reported costs being lower than actual costs and benefits being valued more in the analysis. Risk-averse decision makers report higher costs and lower benefits than the flood defense system actually provides (Voortman 2003). Such bias is often unintentional. An interesting aspect of flood management and risk assessment is how the public perceives risk and the importance of flood protection. Public perception of flood risk can affect budget, construction and maintenance of flood defense systems, and other aspects of flood risk management policy. There are three bases for public risk perception: dormant flood risk, immediate flood threat, and accidental/uncontrolled flooding (Baan and Klijn 2004). Dormant flood risk has two components- crisis effect and levee effect. Crisis effect occurs immediately after a disaster and causes people to overestimate future flood risk. Levee effect starts once protection measures have been taken and causes people to rely too heavily of the protection of the system and then grossly underestimate future flood risk (White 1945). Immediate flood threat occurs during a flood event. As water height increases and comes close to the top of the dike, people feel emotions ranging from fear to inconvenience to solidarity (Baan and Klijn 2004). The degree of fear typically is inversely correlated to experience with flood events. People that live with frequent flooding typically experience less fear than those new to an area or living in an area that has not experienced flooding in several years. Past experience may be the single most important factor affecting people during high water levels. Those who have experienced minor flooding with little or no damage will underestimate the risk of damage. Those who have experienced loss of life or extensive property damage in the past are most likely to experience helplessness and fear (Burn 1999). Evacuation is often perceived as more troublesome and threatening than the high water level (Baan and Klijn 2004). Those that require assistance from others to evacuate (elderly, children, disabled) are the most susceptible to negative feelings during high water events. Interestingly, even the forecast of a high water event may be enough to trigger these feelings. Not all feelings are negative. Feelings of solidarity or togetherness can occur among people who band together during a high water event. The third base for risk perception is uncontrolled flooding. A flood event is linked to several negative effects ranging from premature death to feelings of ill-health and mental distress. These feelings typically fade as time passes after the flood event (Baan and Klijn 2004). Public risk perception has been integrated into the Netherlands' flood strategy with specific regard to incorporating public involvement in decision-making. When the public is more involved and more educated in actual flood risk, negative feelings are reduced (Baan and Klijn 2004). Recent research indicates that people in the Netherlands no longer perceive flooding as a natural disaster, but instead as a failure of the flood management system (Baan and Klijn 2004). This has increased the likelihood that people overestimate the level of protection and place disproportionate trust in the man-made systems. In the earliest days of dike building, landowners were responsible for protecting their property and making dike repairs. As cities formed, coordination among landowners was necessary, regional water authorities started to form. Maintenance costs were still distributed among land owners protected by the dikes and cities were mostly exempt from regular maintenance costs, but the waterschappen had authority to manage the construction, maintenance, and operation of dams, sluices, dikes and drainage canals (Tol and Langen 2000, Kaijser 2002). \"Dike counts,\"dijkgraaf, were executives assigned to inspect dikes three times a year (spring, summer, and fall). The spring inspection identified repairs to be made; the summer inspection made sure that the work had been completed; the fall inspection was a final opportunity to identify problems before the winter. If a land owner was unable to fund repair costs, the dike count would loan the money at interest rates in excess of 100 - 200 percent (Tol and Langen 2000). For extensive repairs or following flood damage, the dike count could raise money by imposing a tax on cities. However, most of the financial burden fell on landowners and frequently these repair costs led to bankruptcy. Often dike counts abused this privilege and were able to amass large amounts of land (Tol and Langen 2000). In 1798, a new constitution and more stable central government led to reorganization of a national budget and the formation of a national water authority (Tol and Langen 2000). The funding for flood protection comes from a combination of inhabitant and property taxes at state, provincial, and municipal levels of government. Provincial governments are responsible for implementing state water policies. Costs for flood protection may be covered by the national general budget, as long as they fit within the following activities: \"Formulation of the national, strategic policy on flood protection and water management, supervision of its realization and enforcement, The realization of the operational tasks concerning the infrastructure, The flood protection works lacking hinterland or financial capacity; the Main Dike separating the Wadden Sea from the Lake IJssel, dams and barriers in the estuaries, dunes and dikes on the Wadden islands, The preservation of the coast by fighting the structural erosion, The operational management of the state waters. These waters concern the Rhine with its branches, the Meuse, the Scheldt, the Lake Ijssel, the estuaries, the principal canals and the territorial and international sea, and The promotion of the (inter)national shipping routes.\" (Huisman 2002: 4). In 1998 (the most recent year with published information), The Netherlands spent 1 percent of its national income (US $ 3.14 billion) on water management - 15 percent of which was for flood protection (US $ 444 million). In the next ten years, the Dutch anticipate spending $2.9 billion on flood protection (Woorden 2006). The Water Board Bank (Nederlandse Waterschapsbank) was formed in 1954 when funding for the substantial repair work caused by the 1953 floods was difficult. The local water boards were too small on their own and formed the collaborative to allow long-term borrowing at favorable rates (Huisman 2002). The Water Board Bank is the fifth largest Dutch bank and is owned by public authorities (81 percent is held by the water boards with state and provincial government holding the remaining 19 percent) (Huisman 2002). Flood damages place a large financial burden on the government as a result of requests for compensation. Previously, insurance policies excluded coverage for flood damages, and the government was responsible for all claims. In 2000, a special committee convened by the Netherlands' government provided recommendations on flood insurance policy (Kok et al. 2002). The committee recommended that the government work with insurance companies to designate flooding as a result of high rains (and no failure of flood defense systems) as part of property insurance. This reduced the governments' exposure to flood damage claims (Kok et al. 2002). Public-private enterprises can help finance flood system improvements. Two recent partnerships include gravel and sand production and urban planning. The Grensmaas project combined private gravel and sand extraction with floodplain lowering (van Stokkom et al. 2005). Private enterprises have also presented plans for floating villages, which allow for river dikes to be moved further inland and maximize the public's willingness to pay for riverfront property. Although these partnerships have potential, so far implementation has been difficult and inefficient (van Stokkom et al. 2005). The Dutch are increasingly incorporating resilience strategies in their flood management policies (Olsthoorn and Tol 2001, Van Steen and Pellenbarg 2004). This is increasingly important as the economic value protected by the flood management system increases faster than dike heightening can occur. The economic value protected has increased nationally by a factor of six in the past 40 years, and more in many local areas. Two strategies are receiving the most attention as potential resilience methods to minimize economic consequences of flooding: storing flood waters and increasing maximum flow capacity of channels (Vis et al. 2003, Hooijer et al. 2004, Silva et al. 2004). In the Netherlands, these two strategies are part of creating \"room for rivers,\" an initiative led by the Dutch government to provide better flood protection and use spatial planning for long-term development (Woorden 2006). The plan includes implementation of resilience measures in the four ways, by dike or levee relocation (setbacks), flood bypasses or \"green rivers\", lowering floodplains between the river and the levees, and developing flood detention areas (Hooijer et al. 2004). The Dutch are currently building a flood bypass along the Ijssel branch of the Rhine to protect the towns of Veessem and Hoenwaard from flood waters. This channel is being built in a mostly agricultural area (Woorden 2006). As part of the same government measure to ensure flood protection objectives are met by 2015, the Dutch are also moving dikes along the Meuse between Geertruidenberg and Waalwik. By moving the dikes further from the river, the area known as the Overdiep Polder will be expanded and water levels in the area will drop up to 30 cm (Woorden 2006). Although both measures reduce developable land, the goal is to maintain agricultural use while protecting more populated areas. Detention of floods in compartments requires designating areas for temporary water storage and subdividing existing dike rings. The compart-mentalized sections will have different flood probabilities resulting from a pre-determined order for rerouting flood waters to the compartments (Vis et al. 2003, Silva et al. 2004). Upstream compartments are filled first to reduce the flood peak's height and duration further downstream. Typically, the compartments designated to receive flood waters first should be designated as natural or agricultural lands to minimize economic damage (Vis et al. 2003). These detention compartments also can be managed to help recharge groundwater supplies, reduce river bed erosion, and improve biodiversity (van Stokkom and Smits 2002). Silva et al. (2004) evaluated the potential for compartmental detention for Rhine flood waters. Because upstream storage is most desired, the Netherlands would have to focus on areas near the German border. To reduce flood water flow from an \"average\" flood hyetograph by 1000 m3/s, 150 million m3 of storage is required. This is equivalent to 3000 hectares (30 km2) flooded to 5 meters (Silva et al. 2004). An increase of 1000 m3/s from 15,000 m3/s (current maximum flow capacity) to 16,000 m3/s results in the probability of the detention area being used in a given year being approximately 1 in 500 (Silva et al. 2004). Such a low probability may lead to people forgetting the purpose of the detention area and begin development in ways that diminish its effectiveness at lessening flood damages. Green rivers or flood bypasses are one method to increase the maximum flow capacity of part of a channel. Green rivers are designated areas where water flows only during flood periods and may be used for agriculture or ecological habitat at other times","citation":"Dana L. Woodall & Jay R.

REPORTS OF CHAPTERS Canada Chapter Mid-Atlantic Chapt Mexico Chapter Southeastern Chapter Southwestern Chapter South American Chapter In spite of the difficult economic times the country is facing, ESA remains financially sound and programmatically strong. Our loyal membership stands near 10,000 and the annual meeting this year in Albuquerque, with its excellent program offerings, is expected to attract more than 3,500 participants. More than 2,000 institutions worldwide subscribe to one or more of our journals which continue to be among the most highly cited in our field. Ecology, which is 90 years old this year, was named by the Special Libraries Association (SLA) as one of the top 100 most influential journals in science and medicine in the past 100 years during an academy award like ceremony during the SLA annual meeting. The reports of the ESA programs which follow show the range of activities that ESA is engaged in and are a testament to the breadth of interests of our members. From congressional briefings on “hot” issues to an energized blog; from specialized conferences and workshops to galvanizing the community behind data sharing; from the continued evolution of our prized diversity program to helping faculty use large scale data sets; and from the ever increasing influence of our journals, ESA demonstrates that it is moving aggressively on many fronts and continues to be a vibrant and energized society. ESA is also looking to the future. The Governing Board has initiated a long range planning process this year that will examine the existing activities of the society and anticipate programs and activities that may be needed in the future. It is our expectation that many of our members will be involved in this effort and be asked to help us ensure that ESA stays relevant far into the future. All of our accomplishments would not be possible without the excellent staff and leadership of the society. I thank the professional staff for their hard work and dedication to the goals of ESA and the leadership and membership for inspiring and guiding our efforts. On a personal note, it is my honor to be named President of the Council of Engineering and Scientific Society Executives (CESSE) –a volunteer position I assumed in July. CESSE is an organization of over 170 scientific and engineering societies. My participation in CESSE provides me with an important network of executives from a diverse group of professional organizations and provides ESA with visibility in the scientific and engineering community. Submitted by: Katherine McCarter After 5 years of growth, ESA membership leveled in 2008. We ended the year with 9,971 members. In addition, 2,028 institutions had subscriptions to one or more of the ESA journals. We anticipate ending the 2008–2009 fiscal year on budget, despite the difficult economic times. Attendance at the meeting in Milwaukee met expectations; library and membership dues and subscription revenue is level, and expenses have been kept within normal variances.

Annual Meeting ESA's 93th Annual Meeting was held in Milwaukee and was successful event. Attendance topped 3,300 and the financial goals set by the Governing Board were met. Upon returning from Milwaukee work immediately began on the 94rd Annual Meeting which will be held in Albuquerque, NM. The meeting theme is: Ecological Knowledge and a Global Sustainable Society. Program Chair Scott Franklin and Local Host Chair Will Pockman, have worked closely with ESA staff in the planning the meeting. A few highlights and new activities: ESA will continue to make a contribution in the amount of $5 per attendee to offset the environmental impact of the meeting. Key note speakers for the Plenary sessions include Sandra Postel, Director of the Global Water Policy Project and Monica Turner, ESA MacArthur lecturer, Department of Zoology, University of Wisconsin, Madison. The Scientific Program includes a NSF-Funded Special Series on Coupled Biogeochemical Cycles, which is composed of 3 OOSs (Tues PM, Wed AM, and Wed PM) and a concluding workshop Wed evening. Work has also begun on the 95th Annual Meeting, which will be held in Pittsburgh, PA August 1-August 6, 2010. Annual Meeting staff. Elizabeth Biggs, CFO, Director of Administration; Michelle Horton, Meeting Manager; Tricia Crocker, Meeting Associate and Registrar; Aleta Wiley, Program Assistant Submitted by: Elizabeth Biggs Over the past year, ESA public affairs activities focused on: conveying ecological information and resources to the media and to policymakers; working to foster support for science; providing policy and media opportunities and training for ESA members, especially graduate students. Sponsored several congressional briefings, a congressional field trip, and one webinar. Topics included climate change, ecosystem services, environmental monitoring, and the ecological tradeoffs of water decisions in the western United States. Continued to produce two podcasts: Field Talk and An Ecologist Goes to Washington. FT highlights the field experiences of authors who have published in Ecology, Ecological Applications and Ecological Monographs. EGWASH features the stories and reflections of scientists who have engaged in policy activities. Revised the look and content of the Society's blog, now called Ecotone, to feature fresh posts several times a week. Readership has increased by 50 percent. Worked closely with the Public Affairs Committee, ESA experts, and Governing Board members to produce a Society position statement on sustainable economic activities. Assisted members of the media on a regular basis, referring them to ESA member experts and resources on issues ranging from fire and climate change to marine conservation. Staff Updates: Piper Corp joined ESA as Science Policy Analyst in July 2009. Corp holds an undergraduate degree in ecology and evolutionary biology from Cornell University and has experience ranging from field research to communications work in the private sector. Environmental Policy The Society produced and released a position statement on sustainable economic activities in July 2009 which focuses on incorporating natural capital into economic decisions. Public affairs staff participated in meetings with congressional staff and colleagues with other scientific societies to discuss pending climate legislation and the role of science and the scientific community. Working with ESA's President Alison Power, staff developed and distributed ESA letters throughout the year which addressed a wide range of issues including: a statement of support for the proper treatment of evolution in the Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills; a letter outlining the Society's concerns about the Bush Administration's proposed changes to the Endangered Species Act; a letter of support for the Nonnative Wildlife Invasions Prevention Act; and a letter to President Obama outlining the ecological community's priorities. ESA alerted Society members throughout the year about opportunities for scientific input on issues including: the Louisiana Science Education Act, which could open the door for creationism and other non-scientific principles in the classroom; a proposal to introduce the Asian Oyster to the Chesapeake Bay; the Nonnative Wildlife Invasions Prevention Act, and the No Child Left Indoors bill. ESA sponsored three congressional briefings, a webinar, and one congressional field trip this year: Climate Change: Intersections of Science and Policy: ESA joined AAAS and several other societies in co-sponsoring House and Senate briefings on the science and policy of climate change. Speakers included Timothy Wirth, former US Representative and Senator and lead U.S. negotiator for the Kyoto Climate Conference; Susan Solomon, a senior scientist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, who co-chaired Working Group 1 of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change; Peter Gleick, president and co-founder of the Pacific Institute for Studies in Development, Environment, and Security; and Ted Parson, Professor of Law and of Natural Resources & Environment at the University of Michigan. Water Resources in the West: Assessing Tradeoffs in a Changing Climate: ESA sponsored congressional briefings featuring ESA members discussing the ecological implications of water management and conservation strategies. Speakers included ESA members Diane Pataki (UC-Irvine), Jill Baron (US Geological Survey), and Darell Jenerette (UC-Riverside). The House Subcommittee on Water and Power and the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee hosted the briefings. From Agricultural to Urban Ecosystems: Nature's Services to Humankind: ESA teamed up with the Council on Food, Agricultural and Resource Economics to offer a webinar on ecosystem services. ESA member Kay Gross moderated and members James Gosz and Richard Pouyat were among the speakers. ESA also sponsored a USGS Capitol Hill briefing focused on climate change and invasive species. Environmental Observatories: ESA teamed up with the National Ecological Observatory Network Inc. and the Smithsonian Institution to hold a congressional field trip to the Smithsonian's Conservation Research Center that featured endangered species and environmental observations. ESA again helped lead a Congressional Visits Day event in which four ESA graduate students and Rapid Response Team member Scott Collins (U. of New Mexico) participated. Jennifer Moslemi (Cornell), Colin Quinn (Colorado State U.), Tanya Skurski (Montana State U.) and Ari Novy (Rutgers) were recipients of ESA's 2009 Graduate Student Policy Award to participate in the event and gain hands-on experience in interacting with policy makers. The group visited 17 congressional offices to promote sustained federal investment in the biological sciences and heard from agency, congressional and White House representatives about the outlook for science research and education. ESA again sponsored an exhibitor at the 15 th annual exhibition and reception of the Coalition for National Science Funding. Travis Huxman, of the University of Arizona and a member of the Society's Rapid Response Team, showcased research funded by the National Science Foundation that looks at climate consequences on ecosystems of the Southwest. In addition to hundreds of congressional staffers, several Members of Congress, including Speaker Nancy Pelosi, attended the event. The Public Affairs Office continued to track and report on the status of legislation, federal science appropriations, and environmental policy activities in the national and international arena through its biweekly Policy News. This year, the Office provided a special post-election edition to all ESA members. ESA also again teamed up with the American Institute of Biological Sciences (AIBS) to write a chapter on the biological and ecological sciences for the annual publication of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, AAAS Report: Research & Development FY 2010. Press More than 15 journalists covered the 2008 ESA Annual Meeting in Milwaukee. Press coverage included articles in Nature, Science, The Washington Post, The Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel and National Geographic News. Scientific American also produced a podcast about a session, and a Nature correspondent kept a blog about the meeting. Three ESA press releases (Climate Change and Species Distributions, The Ecology of Fire, Saving Our Bees) resulted in news coverage, including articles in The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, National Geographic online news and the Washington, D.C.-based environmental magazine, Land Letter. Press preparations for the 2009 Annual Meeting so far have included press releases highlighting symposia and oral sessions and working with university and agency public information officers to generate additional publicity for the meeting. As of July, a dozen press were registered to attend. PAO staff issued over 20 press releases. Media coverage was especially high for the following stories: Transporting Juvenile Salmon Hinders Adult Migration (EA paper); Declining Alaskan Sea Otters Affects Bald Eagles’ Diet (ECOL paper); and Polarized Light Pollution Leads Animals Astray (FIEE paper). Staff continued to field—and direct to appropriate ESA member experts—a steady influx of reporter-initiated calls throughout the year. Inquiries and coverage came from a wide range of press including BBC World News, Science, The New York Times, Associated Press, Reuters, the Canadian Press, CNN, LA Times, Denver Post, Scientific American, Discovery News, National Geographic News, and many others. The National Science Foundation highlighted the outreach initiatives of several scientific organizations, including ESA's increasingly common outreach-geared Annual Meeting sessions as well as the Society's efforts to inform policy through its Rapid Response Teams. http://www.nsf.gov/discoveries/disc_summ.jsp?cntn_id=114406&govDel=USNSF_1 ESA's membership and public affairs staff teamed up to craft a new quarterly email for all ESA members, ESA Today, which offers brief highlights of ESA activities. The Public Affairs Office produced the Society's 12 th Annual Report, which provides an overview of Society activities for ESA members and is useful for meetings with others who are interested in the Society. Public Affairs staff produced 10 Field Talk podcasts featuring lively conversations with researchers and covering such topics as lizard evolution, aquatic dead zones, and biocontrol insects. The Ecologist Goes to Washington showcased interviews with ESA members who have worked on Capitol Hill, worked together with western stakeholders, and worked at the intersection of climate science and policy. Public affairs staff teamed up with AIBS staff to give an all-day policy training workshop to 25 New Mexico junior faculty members. Part of a three-day leadership training program, the policy training provided political context, communication tips, and hands-on exercises. Public Affairs Committee Members of the Society's Public Affairs Committee offer valuable guidance to the organization's public affairs activities especially in reviewing ESA draft position statements and papers. PAC reviewed and provided valuable feedback on the draft ESA statement on sustainable economic activities. The Public Affairs Committee (PAC) met in August 2008 and in May 2009. Working with the Program Committee and Education Vice President, the PAC identified candidates to invite as the Society's Opening Plenary speaker. The Opening Plenary speaker at ESA's 2009 Annual Meeting will be Sandra Postel, Director, Global Water Policy Project. The second recipient of ESA's Regional Policy Award (developed by the PAC and approved by the Governing Board) will be New Mexico Senator Tom Udall, who has been invited to receive the award at the start of the 2009 Opening Plenary. Nominations came from the ESA local host committee and from PAC members. The PAC is sponsoring the symposium, “Global Sustainability in the Face of Uncertainty: How to More Effectively Translate Ecological Knowledge to Policy Makers, Managers, and the Public” at the 2009 Annual Meeting. Members of the PAC are Laura Huenneke (Vice President, Northern Arizona University), Angela Bednarek (Pew Charitable Trusts), Elena Bennett (McGill University), Cheryl Dybas (National Science Foundation), Rick Haeuber (Environmental Protection Agency), and Elizabeth Harp (Colorado State University, ESA Student Representative). Staff The Public Affairs Office is currently staffed by: Nadine Lymn, Director of Public Affairs, Christine Buckley, Communications Officer; and Piper Corp, Science Policy Analyst. Submitted by: Nadine Lymn The Office of Science Programs carries out a broad range of activities in support of the ESA membership, the scientific community, and public agency scientists and decision makers. These activities are grouped into three broad categories. Advancing ecological science includes activities that promote the continued development of ecological science. Ecology for community includes projects that link the ecological research and management communities and help integrate ecological science into decision-making and education. Solutions for sustainability consists of a series of activities to examine and articulate the intellectual foundations for a new sustainability science. These efforts, in collaboration with those of ESA's Education, Public Affairs, and Publications programs, maintain ESA's reputation as a source of reliable knowledge in ecological science. We appreciate the continuing support of the Society and the direct involvement of Society members in Science activities, and we welcome your advice, ideas, and energy. Advancing Ecological Science Data Sharing Initiative Identify incentives and recommend steps to overcome barriers to productive sharing of scientific information from the perspective of funders, researchers, and publishers. Develop ideas for products that will help implement recommendations from the Data Sharing Workshop series. Additional information, including reports from the workshops, is available at the Data Sharing Initiative web site, www.esa.org/science_resources/datasharing.php. Cliff Duke is giving a talk about this initiative at the ESA Annual Meeting. ESA Millennium Conference Planning is continuing for ESA's first Millennium Conference, Water-Ecosystem Services, Drought & Environmental Justice, to be held November 9–12, 2009, at the University of Georgia. The conference is being co-chaired by Ted Gragson of the University of Georgia and Steward Pickett of the Cary Institute of Ecosystem Studies. Confirmed invited speakers include past ESA Presidents Nancy Grimm and Ann Bartuska. The organizing committee has invited approximately 50 researchers, and invitees also will include 20 students whose travel will be paid by a grant from NSF. About 25 attendees have been selected from an open call for poster abstracts. Additional information will be posted on the Millennium Conference web site, esa.org/millenniumconf/2009/index.php as it is developed. ESA Panel on Vegetation Classification The Science Office continues to provide support to the ESA Panel on Vegetation Classification, which will become a standing committee of ESA, pending a Council vote at the 2009 Annual Meeting. The Panel's manuscript “Description, documentation, and evaluation of associations and alliances within the U.S. National Vegetation Classification (NVC),” was published in the May 2009 Ecological Monographs. The Panel's efforts will now be focused on peer review and training support for the NVC, with funding expected from the U.S. Forest Service later in the year. For this year's Annual Meeting, the Panel has organized a workshop, “The New National Vegetation Classification Standard: An Introduction to the System with Field Applications and Training,” and an organized oral session, “US National Vegetation Classification as a Tool for Sustainable Environmental Management and Conservation.” Additional information on Panel activities and a link to the Ecological Monographs paper are available on the Panel website, esa.org/vegweb. Ecology for Community Ecological Dimensions of Biofuels: Conference and Workshop Work continues on products from this March 2008 conference and workshop. Science Director Cliff Duke made a presentation at the 2008 annual meeting of the Society for Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry, and led a breakout session on biofuels and biodiversity at the 2008 National Council on Science and the Environment meeting. Conference manuscripts have been submitted for publication in Ecological Applications, and a Policy Forum was published in Science. A series of four reports on biofuels and sustainability and an Issue in Ecology based on the manuscripts are being prepared for nonscientist audiences. The Science Office has also developed a web site with information about biofuels at www.esa.org/science_resources/biofuelsResources.php. Ecosystem Services Provided by Agricultural Wetlands The Science Office is working with the USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service to develop a set of nine articles about conservation practice effects on ecosystem services provided by wetlands on agricultural landscapes, along with a nontechnical summary for distribution to decision-makers and the general public. The articles have been submitted to Ecological Applications for review. The summary is being prepared by Science staff and will be distributed by the Office. Issues in Ecology The Science Office provides staff support to ESA's Issues in Ecology series (www.esa.org/science_resources/issues.php). Four new Issues are currently funded. As noted previously, an Issue on biofuels and sustainability is being developed, with support from the Energy Foundation. An Issue on forest carbon sequestration is being prepared under the leadership of Mike Ryan of the Forest Service, with support from the Forest Service. U.S. EPA's Clean Air Markets Division is providing funding for an Issue on “Protecting Ecosystems from Air Pollutant Deposition: A Thresholds Approach,” and the EPA National Exposure Research Laboratory is funding an Issue to be based on the 2009 Millennium Conference. NBII Web Site on Pollinators Under a cooperative agreement with the National Biological Information Infrastructure (NBII), over the last three years, the Science Office developed a Pollinators web site (pollinators.nbii.gov) encompassing a wide range of information on pollinators and organized in a central location. The site includes text and links to other sites that house image galleries, identification guides, datasets, fact sheets, species profiles, and monitoring protocols. Peer Review Support The Science Office is managing the scientific peer review of a set of ten assessments of the historic range of variation of Rocky Mountain Ecosystems for the U.S. Forest Service's Region 2. Each report is reviewed by the review panel chair and four other reviewers. Dr. Duncan Patten has chaired the most recent reviews. Eight reports have been reviewed and the reviews submitted to the Forest Service. Science is part of a team led by RTI International's Mary Barber (former ESA Science Director) that is conducting a peer review of USGS Biological Resources Discipline programs, with a final review panel meeting scheduled for August 2009 and a report to be delivered in early 2010. ESA's roles include helping develop the review methodology, identifying candidate review panelists, and participating in review panel meetings and report preparation. USGS National Climate Change and Wildlife Science Center Science staff are working in partnership with The Wildlife Society (TWS) and the Meridian Institute to help the USGS plan a new National Climate Change and Wildlife Science Center. The team members managed a comprehensive review workshop (December 3–4, 2008) for stakeholder input and supported a series of smaller meetings in May through July 2009. The team will publish a final report to guide Center development in Fall 2009. Additional information on the Center is available at http://nccw.usgs.gov. Solutions for Sustainability This effort has included a series of activities, including a special session at the 2005 Annual Meeting, a symposium at the 2007 Annual Meeting, a workshop at Brown University in March 2007, and a symposium at the 2008 AAAS meeting. The project is led by a Steering Committee chaired by Gus Shaver and including Terry Chapin, Cliff Duke, Ann Kinzig, Debra Peters, and Osvaldo Sala. Annual Meeting Activities The Science Office is organizing or participating in a number of activities at the 2009 Annual Meeting. These include meetings of the Science Committee, the Meetings Committee, the Vegetation Classification Panel, and the Issues in Ecology Editorial Board. Vice President for Science Rob Jackson and Science Director Duke are coorganizing the symposium “The Environmental Effects of Geoengineering.” Duke and Dr. Gary Machlis are coorganizing a special session on War Ecology and hosting an evening screening of the documentary film “Scarred Lands and Wounded Lives,” which explores the environmental impacts of war. Duke will also make an oral presentation, “Development of Incentives for Data Sharing in Ecology, Evolution, and Organismal Biology,” reporting on the most recent ESA workshop on data sharing. Other Activities Science staff also participate in the scientific community in ways that help communicate ESA capabilities to the community and in turn inform the efforts of staff in the projects and activities summarized above. For example, Program Manager Corrie Mauldin participates in the Sustainable Water Resources Roundtable (SWRR), which is working to test and integrate their set of environmental indicators with various partners, and Program Assistant Aleta Wiley has helped organize the annual National Invasive Weeds Awareness Week in Washington. Director Cliff Duke serves on the Steering Committee for the Sustainable Rangelands Roundtable (SRR), which is developing sustainability indicators for rangelands, and on EPA's Board of Scientific Counselors, which advises EPA's Office of Research and Development. Science Committee The Science Office thanks the members of the Science Committee, who provide valuable advice and input on Office projects: Rob Jackson, Chair (Duke University), Laurie Drinkwater (Cornell University), Susan Cameron (Harvard), Susan Harrison (UC-Davis), Jeff Herrick (USDA-ARS Jornada Experimental Range), Elisabeth Huber-Sannwald (IPICYT), Lawrence Kapustka (LK Consulting), Richard Pouyat (USDA Forest Service), and Phil Robertson (Michigan State University). Staff Cliff Duke, Program Director; Corrie Mauldin, Program Manager; Aleta Wiley, Program Assistant. Submitted by: Cliff Duke Between July 2008 and June 2009, ESA's Office of Education and Diversity Programs developed some fresh strategies and initiatives to advance our award-winning SEEDS mentoring program and exciting faculty development opportunities. We have also had the opportunity to join with other organizations and programs interested in K16 ecology and biology education. Over the next year, we will deepen our strategy to better integrate our programs to mutually support programmatic goals. I. Strategies for Ecology Education, Diversity and Sustainability (SEEDS) To better reflect the audience we are serving, the staff and SEEDS Advisory Board have agreed to make a change in the program name, replacing Development with Diversity. As of January 1, 2009, SEEDS read: Strategies for Ecology Education, Diversity and Sustainability.

The emphasis on this aspect of water resources management has expanded and contracted over time. For a very limited period in the 1960s and 1970s, there was some degree of coordination of Federal research investments, but the organizations that fostered that coordination have evaporated. As we look to the future, the questions of whether we really need new Federal investments in water resources technology and, if so, what those investments should be, remain as viable and important questions. Furthermore, given the increasing public policy focus on energy as an issue of national security, it is essential to include within the public dialogue recognition of the interdependence of water and energy production. Current energy policy, in an attempt to move towards domestic energy resources, favors resources that require increasing amounts of water for production, such as corn. Simultaneously, thermo-electric power production is predicted to increase over time. This power production requires a certain amount of water to function and, therefore, one can predict that, without increased efficiencies, demand for water will also increase. As policy moves towards alternative energy sources, the affect of the production of these sources on water supply, demand, and quality should be observed. Conversely, water uses and supplies often require energy (e.g., desalination plants), so, as our energy resources become scarcer, we must recognize the affect that our water usage has on our energy supply. Obviously, the first issue is whether there is a need for better protected or expanded water supplies and, if so, are there specific sectors of water demand that need greater attention. If there is a need, then the next question is whether or not developing technology should be one of the important mechanisms for achieving this goal. If so, then, we must determine what part of technology development should be underwritten by Federal investment. Finally, we would need to determine some path forward that acknowledges the existing programs and investments by multiple Federal agencies and allows some form of concerted effort to proceed. This paper is written to provide a snapshot into the current dialog on this topic, offer an additional perspective to the dialogue by including discussions regarding energy and water interdependency, and, finally, to provide an outline for the debate. Across our nation, we use water in two categorically different ways. First, we use water that is withdrawn or extracted and used outside the natural system or hydrosphere. Second, we use water that remains in the natural system. Both provide critical benefits. To sustain the United States' current population of over 300 million people, we withdraw around 345 billion gallons of water a day. This equals 30 percent of all the runoff in the United States. Of these withdrawals, approximately 30 percent is consumed. So approximately 10 percent of all surface runoff (our renewable supply) is consumed currently (Subcommittee on Water Availability and Quality 2007). We use the remainder of the water to provide dilution of municipal, industrial and agricultural discharges; environmental water needs; river based transportation; energy production and support other needs. It is difficult to measure the fraction of the non-diversion capacity currently used. The biota and physical structures of ecosystems provide a wide variety of marketable goods – fish and lumber being two familiar examples. Moreover, society is increasingly recognizing the myriad life support functions, the observable manifestations of ecosystem processes that ecosystems provide and without which human civilizations could not thrive…These include water purification, recharging of groundwater, nutrient recycling, decomposition of wastes, regulation of climate, and maintenance of biodiversity. Despite the importance of ecosystem functions and services, they are often overlooked or taken for granted and their value implicitly set at zero in decisions concerning conservation or restoration.” However, one indicator might be the degree of water quality degradation measured by the U.S. Geological Survey's water quality assessment program. A recent nationwide study of 178 streams found that low levels of pesticides were detected in all streams studied and a little over 83 percent of sample locations along streams in urban settings had concentrations that could impact aquatic life forms (Gilliom et al. 2006). Other indicators of water use would likely show similar results. Without comprehensive information, it is hard to be conclusive, but results like those above indicate that we now use all our available water in either direct or indirect ways. Over the last 25 years, our per-capita water use has decreased, allowing a degree of stability in total water withdrawals. For example, California, due to its burgeoning population and extensive state resources, has assessed and actively pursued conservation at local and state levels. As a consequence, urban use has remained essentially the same as they have added over 3.5 million (around 10 percent) more residents in the last 10 years (California Department of Water Resources 2005). The decoupling of increased water use with increased population is due primarily to greater efficiency in water use or conservation. How long this race between increased population and decreased per-capita use can continue is unclear. One view point is that there remains a very large possible flexibility to increase conservation. Since 1975, per capita water use in the United States has fallen at an annual rate of 1.4 percent. Even absolute water withdrawals peaked about 1980. Industry, alert to technology as well as costs, exemplifies the progress, although it consumes a small fraction of total water. Total U.S. industrial water withdrawals plateaued about 1970, and have since dropped by one-third … Also interesting is that industrial withdrawals per unit of GNP have dropped steadily since 1940. Then, 14 gallons of water flowed into each dollar of output. Now the flow is less than three gallons per dollar…Technology, law, and economics have all favored frugal water use.…Despite the gains, the United States is far from the most efficient practices. Water withdrawals for all users in the OECD countries range tenfold, with the United States and Canada the highest. Allowing for national differences in the major uses (irrigation, electrical cooling, industry, and public water supply), large opportunities for reductions remain At the same time, pressure on water supplies is mounting. Many southwestern cities have reduced per-capita domestic water use to 120-140 gallons per day and find it very costly and difficult to further reduce water consumption below these levels. At the same time, population in the U.S. is anticipated to grow by another 25 percent to around 390 million by the year 2050 (Cheeseman Day 2007). It is highly unlikely that the entire increase in water demand due to population increase will be offset by efficiencies. Withdrawals for the two largest non-domestic users of water, irrigation and thermoelectric power production, are about equal at 40 percent each (Subcommittee on Water Availability and Quality 2007). Dramatic changes in energy policy encouraging ethanol production including the President's call for 35 billion gallons of ethanol per year by 2017 (2007 State of the Union Address) and increased demand for electricity at least proportional to population growth will likely increase both these demands. A recent National Academies review believes that in the short run, production of crops for ethanol will be offset by decreases in production of other irrigated agriculture. At the same time the amount of fertilizer and pesticide loading on rivers will increase. Thus, the consumptive use of water may not increase, but our dilution use will (National Research Council 2007). For electric power production, the water use per kilowatt hour produced has decreased by two-thirds since 1950 and an aggressive research agenda has been proposed to further reduce this dependence (Electric Power Research Institute 2007). However, even with these encouraging results, total electricity demand is anticipated to increase by 41 percent by 2030 regardless of increases in energy efficiency (Energy Information Administration 2007). The result is a significant increase in water withdrawals for one or both of the two main uses of water. It is likely, therefore, that each of the three main uses of water – agriculture irrigation, thermo-electric power production, and municipal-industrial uses – will all increase significantly in the near future. An additional aspect of efficiency is flexibility under stress. Just as electric power generation excess capacity (ability to produce more electricity than normal demand) provides a buffer for short periods of high demand and is critical to long-term stability and reliability of the electricity supply, so too is excess capacity important in water supplies. During times of drought, water in storage and the ability to become even more efficient or conserve for short periods of time is important. As overall average efficiency improves, the excess capacity diminishes and along with it the ability to react without huge societal disruption to drought periods. Along with conservation, there has been a plethora of calls for Federal investment. One fairly cohesive assessment comes through a Government Accounting Office report wherein state water managers were interviewed on this topic. State water managers ranked federal actions that could best help states meet their water resource needs. They preferred: 1) financial assistance to increase storage and distribution capacity; 2) water data from more locations; 3) more flexibility in complying with or administering federal environmental laws; 4) better coordinated federal participation in water-management agreements; and 5) more consultation with states on federal or tribal use of water rights. A second voice on this topic, the American Water Works Association through their National Water Policy Dialogues, have advocated for 1) integrated water management approaches and 2) Federal roles in providing technology, information and collaborative solutions (AWRA 2007) as means to stretch or expand water supplies. The National Science and Technology Council, Committee on Environment and Natural Resources, Subcommittee on Water Availability and Quality identified three primary challenges that must be addressed to ensure an adequate water supply: The United States should accurately assess the quantity and quality of its water resources, should accurately measure how water is used, and should know how water supply and use change over time The United States possesses significant volumes of water that cannot currently be used because they are of marginal quality. The national water supply will be bolstered by the treatment and use of these marginal or impaired waters. Just as water managers now rely on information provided by scientists to make informed decisions about the use of existing water resources, so science and technology will help expand management choices and help expand the water supply. Expanding the water supply should be accomplished through technological means by making poor-quality water usable. Efficiency also plays an essential role; increased water efficiencies will be achieved through both technological and institutional mechanisms Today's decisions and policies will shape our water future. The effectiveness of those decisions depends on the quality of information and on incorporating knowledge about the reliability (or conversely, the uncertainty) associated with predictive management tools. In addition to improved water data, the United States should develop and expand a variety of forecasting and predictive models and systems. Scientists should improve our knowledge of how water resources change because of natural events and human actions. We should develop an array of tools, using behavioral, management, and other social sciences, to educate and influence water-use behavior of individual water users, businesses, industries, and resource managers It is instructive that the state managers representing state interests, AWRA as a broad non-governmental policy development organization, and the Whitehouse Office of Science and Technology Policy as the official policy development arm of the Administration, have reached similar conclusions on what roles the Federal government should play outside direct subsidies. They recommend investment in: Direct support for infrastructure rehabilitation or installation; Knowing the resource; Leading water users in more integrated planning and operations; and Research into treatment and efficiency to expand the supply. If Federal investment is warranted, then which agencies or organizations should undertake which tasks? At present, 20 Federal agencies and bureaus under six cabinet departments have responsibility for water resources management in some way and are directed by 13 Congressional committees with 23 subcommittees and 5 appropriations subcommittees (American Water Resources Association 2007). Unraveling this morass is beyond the scope of this paper, but let it suffice that multiple agencies (and their corresponding Congressional committees) are responsible for each of the potential solutions. Finally, to what degree should the Federal government have a lead role in addressing these topics? As of 1994, The Federal Government had invested $21.8 billion in 133 Western water infrastructure projects pursuant to the Reclamation Act of 1902. Of this, $16.8 billion is scheduled to be repaid (GAO 1997), leaving a relatively small total investment of $5 billion over 90 years. The annual appropriation to the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation to implement operations, maintenance, new projects, undertake environmental activities and research hovers around $1 billion (U.S. Bureau of Reclamation 2007). Additionally, the Federal government has maintained a formal role in financing the nation's drinking water (e.g., Safe Drinking Water Act of 1974) and wastewater systems (e.g., Water Pollution Control Act of 1948) for over fifty years. The investment has been extensive. Since 1948, Congress has appropriated $77.6 billion including $25.5 billion in the State Revolving Fund capitalization grants to improve wastewater management. Congress has also appropriated $9.5 billion for the Drinking Water State Revolving Loan Fund through 2007 to strengthen drinking water systems. Nevertheless, the gap between what we need to invest in our infrastructure and the level of currently available investment is growing. In 2003, the Environmental Protection Agency estimated that national drinking water systems need to invest $276.8 billion over the next 20 years to meet current and new drinking water regulations, not including the cost to maintain and improve wastewater systems (Copeland and Tiemann 2007). The commitment to continue Federal funding exists, but there is conflict over how much Federal investment is appropriate. The Federal investment in fiscal year 2007 for the Clean Water State Revolving Fund grants was $1.08 billion and the investment for the Drinking Water State Revolving Fund grants was $837.5 million. President George W. Bush's proposed budget for fiscal year 2008 for the Clear Water State Revolving Fund was $687.6 million or a decrease of over 30 percent from the amount enacted in 2007 (Congressional Research Service 2007). At the same time, a large number of members of Congress have supported authorizing legislation to expand both the size and the scope of these funds. For example the Water Quality Financing Act of 2007 (H.R. 720) was introduced by Representative James L. Oberstar and 32 colleagues on January 1, 2007. The bill has passed by the House of Representatives in March 2008 and is under consideration in the Senate. This legislation would greatly expand the scope of the projects to be undertaken by existing Environmental Protection Agency infrastructure programs and would add new investment funds. This obvious conflict over local needs represented by members of Congress and the national budget constraints represented by the Administration has lead to significant conflict over the amount of investment (Congressional Research Service 2007). Nevertheless, neither branch of government has proposed eliminating Federal support for water infrastructure needs. Local municipal financing of the full life-cycle costs for water and wastewater is one of the four main policy positions of the Environmental Protection Agency. Nevertheless, the Agency has published a list of 88 Federal or local funding mechanisms that can be used by individual communities to pay for infrastructure improvements (Environmental Protection Agency 2007). The examples provided here are not comprehensive in their description of the Federal investment in water-related infrastructures. However, they provide the flavor of the current investment and debate over the future. What is clear is that the cost of infrastructure development, maintenance and operation is growing, the regulatory requirements and therefore the cost of current operations are increasing, and the Federal government is not unified in its policy positions or its planning for future investment in water infrastructure. The dichotomy between providing assistance and advocating independence is maintained in nearly every Federal water infrastructure support program. Due to the enormous costs, this area of Federal responsibility is likely to remain contentious. The remaining three topic areas fall under the heading of research and development. According to a definition used by the Office of Science and Technology Policy, the Federal role in water resources science or technology research depends on the degree of “public good” measured by whether the benefits of the research are widely dispersed and whether the research “is being or even can be addressed by institutions other than the Federal government” (Subcommittee on Water Availability and Quality 2007). This definition presumes some partnership between public and private investment that can and maybe should evolve so that if private or non-Federal government investments are sufficient to cover an area of research, the Federal interest and investment is diminished. At the same time, it acknowledges that some activities are likely to be a permanent Federal responsibility. Of these potentially Federal responsibilities, collection of national water resources data appears to be a logical responsibility. The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), and other agencies currently work to assess the extent of our national water resources. Initial characterization and long-term monitoring go hand in hand. One area of water monitoring – water quality – has received significant attention. The National Water Quality Monitoring Council, consisting of representatives of multiple agencies, has worked to: champion and support water-quality information aspects of natural-resources management and environmental protection. The National Council has a broad mandate that encompasses water quality monitoring and assessment that includes considerations of water quality in relation to water quantity. The purpose of the National Council is to coordinate and provide guidance and technical support for the voluntary implementation of the recommendations presented in the Strategy for Improving Water-Quality Monitoring in the United States (the strategy) by government agencies and the private sector. The intent of the strategy …is to stimulate the monitoring improvements needed to achieve comparable and scientifically defensible information on interpretations and evaluations of water-quality conditions. The information is required to support decision-making at local, state, interstate, regional, tribal, and national scales However, monitoring programs, their assessment, and mapping programs are progressively decreasing in size. For example, between 2004 and 2005, the U.S. Geological Survey has had to discontinue collecting stream gage information at 175 stations with over 30 years of continuous data and is facing the need to discontinue another 165 if funding is not increased. The actual funding for these stream gaging programs has, at best, been stable. At the same time, a group of gaging advocates representing state and local government, and many national interests believe that the National Streamflow Information Program is only funded at 15 percent of what is needed (Letter to Secretary Kempthorne, August 17, 2006). The Federal role in assessing national resources seems clear, but the relative importance of this responsibility (funding priority) and which agencies have which roles is not (Office of Science and Technology Policy 2007). Self identified research priorities exist in each agency and some cross agency discussion has occurred, but true coordinated development of research agencies has yet to occur (Helweg et al. 2006). In the absences of direct administrative action to expand existing water resources monitoring and assessment activities, Senator Jeff Bingaman has introduced and Senator Domenici cosponsored legislation to expand existing programs and produce national, consistent water data. The Science and Engineering to Comprehensively Understand & Responsibly Enhance Water Act (also known as the SECURE Water Act – S. 2156) was enacted in October 4, 2007 and is designed to accomplish the following tasks. Direct the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation to assess the risk of climate change, develop strategies to counteract the impacts and undertake feasibility assessment on potential solutions. Direct the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation to provide financial assistance up to $5,000,000 per application on a 50/50 cost share for projects to increase water efficiency or issue grants for research to improve water efficiency or management. Direct the Department of Energy and the Power Marketing Administrations to assess potential climate change impacts on hydropower production. Create the Climate Change & Water Intra-Governmental (I-G) Panel to assess climate change impacts on water resources, develop strategies to respond and fund small demonstration projects to implement the strategies. Direct the U.S. Geological Survey to integrate and expand the National Streamflow Information Program, develop a national groundwater monitoring program, identify brackish water resources across the nation, develop new tools to measure water resources, and to expand the existing programs to assess national water resources and uses. This legislation has yet to be heard in Committee hearings and has no House of Representatives counterpart. Nevertheless, it is an initial attempt to close the gap on our lack of information on our national water resources and water needs. Every water policy review has identified a need for greater cooperation among local, state and Federal water management organizations to synchronize operations, policies and new development. At the national level there is no coordinated process for considering water resources research needs, for prioritizing them for funding purposes, or for evaluating the effectiveness of research activities. As a result, local cooperation organizations are springing up to fill this void. For example, the Middle Rio Grande Endangered Species Collaborative Program was formed seven to eight years ago to deal with endangered species issues along a section of the Rio Grande in central New Mexico. This organization's mandate is fairly narrow, but it is an example of the emerging trend toward local, state, and Federal cooperation on water issues. Nevertheless, we lack national water coordination. This has not always been the case. In April 1959, the U.S. Senate created a Select Committee on National Water Resources motivated in part by one of the worst droughts in the Nation's history. After nearly two years, the Committee reported to the full Senate a series of major recommendations: Streamflow regulation through reservoir construction and watershed management; Water quality improvement through more adequate pollution abatement programs; Better use of underground storage; Increased efficiency in water use and substitution of air for water cooling; Increasing natural water yield by desalting, weather modification, and other means. The committee recommended that the Federal Government should undertake a coordinated scientific research program on water, aimed both at increasing available water supplies and making more efficient use of existing supplies. It was recommended that this would be accomplished primarily by 1) expanding basic research programs, deemed essential by the committee for major breakthrough in water resources, 2) a more balanced and better constructed program of applied research for increasing water supplies, 3) an expanded program of applied research for water conservation and making better use of available water resources, and 4) evaluation of completed projects with a view to making them more effective in meeting changing needs and providing better guidelines for future projects (Senate Report 1969). After significant debate, the recommendations resulted in passage of the Water Resources Research Act of 1964 (P.L. 88-379) and the Water Resources Planning Act of 1965 (P.L. 89-80). Additionally, the recommendations resulted in the 1961 amendments to the Water Pollution Control Act; extension of the saline water conversion program in 1961 and 1965; and research and development funding for weather modification techniques (Senate Report 1969). The Water Resources Planning Act of 1965 created the Water Resources Council in the Whitehouse and allowed for creation of multiple river basin commissions. The Water Resources Research Act of 1964 created the Water Resources Research Institutes at land grant colleges (Senate Report 1969). Title I of the 1965 Water Resources Planning Act established a Water Resources Council to be composed of Cabinet representatives, including the Secretary of the Interior. Title II established River Basin Commissions and stipulated their duties and authorities. The Council was empowered to maintain a continuing assessment of the adequacy of water supplies in each region of the U.S. In addition, the Council was mandated to establish principles and standards for Federal participants in the preparation of river basin plans and in evaluating Federal water projects. Upon receipt of a river basin plan, the Council was required to review the plan with respect to agricultural, urban, energy, industrial, recreational, and fish and wildlife needs. Title III established a grant program to assist States in participating in the development of related comprehensive water and land use plans. The law creating the Council was never repealed but some of the functions of the Council have been redirected. The Water Resources Council is now defunct. However, the Water Resources Research Institutes are still with us, but do not function in a way as to carry a nation-wide research agenda. To some degree, similar but more narrowly defined responsibilities reside in the Council on Environmental Quality in the Whitehouse which, “coordinates federal environmental efforts and works closely with agencies and other White House offices in the development of environmental policies and initiatives” (http://www.whitehouse.gov/ceq/aboutceq.html). Nevertheless, the Council does not maintain a strong interest or coordination role in water resources management. It is then clear, that some degree of national level cooperation is needed, and that currently this function is only weakly performed at best. If a new coordination role is defined for all water resources or just a single theme in the process, there are several objectives that should be met through the coordination effort. A proposal developed by the National Research Council for coordination includes: doing a regular survey of water resources research using input from federal agency representatives; advising the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and Congress on the content and balance of a long-term national water resources research agenda every three to five years; advising OMB and Congress on the adequacy of mission-driven research budgets of the federal agencies; advising OMB and Congress on key priorities for fundamental research that could form the core of a competitive grants program; and engaging in vertical coordination with states, industry, and other stakeholders, which would ultimately help refine the agenda-setting process (National Research Council 2004a). With these principals in mind, a new model for coordination on research and development related to the interdependency of energy and water systems has been proposed as part of the Water for Energy, Energy for Water Efficiency Act of 2007 discussed below. The final area of potential Federal investment is in developing technology to help expand water supplies. Our nation faces the following options: we can either find additional funding to rehabilitate and expand our nation's water systems at the enormous costs described above, or we can invest in finding less expensive solutions, or both. This is not a new question. Following an extensive build up of investment by the Environmental Protection Agency in wastewater management grants in the mid-70s, there was recognition that improved technology might reduce the long-term costs for both the Fed","citation":"Erik K.

economists are well aware of the many demands by policy makers and the wider society for improving the basic conditions of food security, poverty reduction, clean environment, and efficient, if not fair, trade. Traditional research issues related to production efficiency and technology adoption have, therefore, gradually been broadened to include several new topics in the research agenda, addressing questions of food safety, supply chain integration, water scarcity and biodiversity management, migration, and the nonfarm economy. The conference program for the 26th Conference of the International Association of Agricultural Economics (IAAE) provided a wide opportunity for scholars to present their research findings and to enter into debate with peers and policy makers. The conference took place in Gold Coast (Australia) and assembled more than 1,000 attendants during the week of 12–18 August 2006. The conference committee was extremely pleased to receive almost 850 contributed papers and after thorough review a total of 358 papers were selected, of which eventually 320 were presented in 72 panel sessions.1 A particular effort was made to structure the paper presentations along a number of thematic lines, thus enabling the participants to discuss related issues and compare the research methodologies applied to similar questions. Another important consideration was to define tracks throughout the program. Thus, six critical policy issues emerged as major areas of concern to researchers: Poverty and Food Security (41 papers), Markets and Institutions (70 papers), Technical Change in Agriculture (49 papers), Environment and Development (58 papers), Consumers and Supply Chains (57 papers), and Trade and Integration (46 papers). The first two issues focus on the prospects for reducing hunger and poverty, either through targeted support measures or by improving poor peoples' access to factor markets and institutions. The next two issues address different options for improving resource use efficiency and environmental sustainability in agricultural production. Finally, the last two issues deal with commodity markets and exchange, trade regulations, and the functioning of (inter)national value chains. We will discuss briefly the most important demands to the profession that are relevant in each of these policy areas, followed by an overview of recent contributions from research to address these issues. Main attention is given to the identification of new topics and/or innovative analytical approaches that were presented during the conference.2 The selected papers included in this special issue provide an adequate illustration of the progress in our professional field in each of the thematic fields and can thus be considered as outstanding pieces of research that deserve our full attention. Problems of (rural) poverty and food security have always received major attention in agricultural economics. The fundamental role of the agricultural sector in providing food to the growing urban population during the transition process of the economy, and the possibilities for improving agricultural productivity (per unit of land and labor) represent classical—albeit still highly relevant—research issues (Johnston and Mellor, 1961; Schultz, 1964; Timmer, 2002). Food security is increasingly addressed from the demand side, paying attention to rural employment and purchasing power as key determinants for getting access to food. Consequently, rural poverty should also be considered in relation to the imperfect functioning of factor and commodity markets and the prevailing constraints in the institutional setting (see also Section 3), thus giving rise to a more complete understanding of the structural causes of chronic poverty and food insecurity (Pingali, 2006). During the last decade, the discussion on rural poverty has been substantially broadened, paying attention to the options for nonfarm and off-farm employment and (inter)national migration as potential pathways out of poverty (Haggblade et al., 2002). The classical debate regarding the future of smallholder farms thus became more oriented toward so-called outside options (Lipton, 2005). Whereas the importance of labor market engagement is now generally acknowledged, it became also clear that this may give rise to large socioeconomic differentiation and new inequalities (Reardon et al., 1992). China is a critical case in this respect, facing rapidly increasing income gaps between rural and urban areas. Within the framework of the Millennium Development Goals, the attention for measuring progress in poverty reduction and for identifying pockets of chronic poverty strongly increased. The growing availability of detailed data sets for poverty measurement—made available from the country-wide Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers—encouraged new research regarding intertemporal poverty dynamics, spatial poverty targeting, and intrahousehold income distribution. In addition, innovative analytical tools for analyzing poverty-growth linkages at household, village, and regional level enable a better understanding of the diversity of pathways out of poverty. The three selected papers included in this special issue address poverty and food security from different angles. Arndt and Simler present a poverty analysis using endogenous absolute poverty lines with data from Mozambique, proposing a bootstrapping method for reducing the impact of sampling errors on poverty measures. They consistently demonstrate that this procedure, accounting for specified differences in poverty across geographical domains, has many advantages compared to traditional approaches. Yamano analyzes the long-term economic impacts of orphanhood mostly as a result of the AIDS epidemic, examining the education attainment and land inheritance of former orphans, who have lost at least one parent before reaching the age of 15 years, using household survey data from Kenya. The paper finds clear indications of lower educational attainment among former maternal orphans, but no significant difference in land inheritance. Finally, Kuiper and Ruben provide a stylized microsimulation model with material from a remote village in Northern Ethiopia to analyze the role of heterogeneous household assets in policies aiming at poverty reduction, indicating the implications for within-village income inequality and soil erosion. Three sets of policies are explored: technology improvement, infrastructure investment, and off-farm employment through migration or cash for work programs. While single policy instruments could reduce poverty headcount but frequently increase income inequality, combining market and employment policies assists poorer households better to overcome their asset limitations. Reducing the reliance of households on agriculture offers a win-win situation of reducing poverty and maintaining natural resources. Combining policies thus may be helpful to overcome asset limitations, to target policies to the poorest households and to reduce income inequalities. Market and institutional reforms are increasingly considered as a key element in policy strategies toward economic participation and sustainable growth. In many developing countries, structural adjustment programs (SAP) that started in the 1980s were intended to reduce market failures and to eliminate the traditional urban bias (Krueger, 1992). In a similar vein, reforms in property rights regimes (i.e., land titling) and privatization of former state services were meant to accompany a more market-based development. However, given the fact that rural markets in developing countries are rather thin and that barriers to entry tend to prevent real competition, results of the SAPs proved to be rather ambiguous (Badiane, 2000). Recent progress in thinking about the nature of rural markets and the endogenous character of agrarian institutions (Binswanger, 2006) gives room to new research concerning the role of transaction costs, risk management, and property rights regimes in economic development. Attention is therefore given to options for strengthening institutional relations and collective action between rural agents (including public–private partnerships) and strategies for managing price variability over time and space (Gilbert, 1998). Earlier analyses regarding the operations of factor markets for land, labor, and finance markets (Binswanger et al., 1994) are extended to adequately address market interlinkages, while strategies for improved commodity market integration and supply chain management are launched to improve price transmission and bargaining power (see also Section 6). The three selected papers that deal with rural markets and institutions provide a good illustration of current progress in research. The paper by Fort analyzes the impact of changes in asset inequality on economic growth, using a time-variant measure for land distribution with a panel database that includes observations for more than 30 countries over three decades. A system GMM estimator is used to generate unbiased and consistent regression estimates. The study finds robust and significant negative signs for land inequality in the growth regressions, indicating that changes in asset distribution are an important factor in economic development. Differences in property rights regimes and education prove to be critical to guarantee adequate transmission. Brosig et al. analyze the dynamics of labor market participation of Chinese rural households. Based on a farm household framework, the choice between four distinct labor market participation states is empirically analyzed. A discrete time hazard approach is used to analyze households' labor market participation histories, particularly the movements between autarky and participation and the shifts between part- and full-time farming. Results suggest a decreasing risk of moving from one regime to another with an increasing time a household resides in one of these states. Furthermore, the likelihood of starting any participation in labor markets and to start part-time farming are considerably higher than to end participation or to return to full-time farming. Kassie and Holden analyze the efficiency of sharecropping systems in Ethiopia, comparing the traditional model of the Marshallian inefficiency with threats of eviction hypotheses that have opposite effects on land productivity of sharecropped plots. Empirical results were consistent with the latter hypothesis, finding higher land productivity on sharecropped plots than on share tenants' own plots, and higher land productivity on sharecropped plots of nonkin than compared to kin tenants. The data analysis allows controls for unobservable household characteristics and for observable plot characteristics. First-order stochastic dominance analysis indicates that sharecropped plots' yield distribution clearly dominated the yield distribution from share tenants' own plots, whereas nonkin sharecropped plots' output value distribution also dominated the output value distribution from kin sharecrop plots. Research on improved and more efficient production technologies for cropping and livestock activities belongs to the core of the agricultural economics profession. Based on extensive field surveys among representative farmers, sound conclusions can be drawn regarding optimal input allocation and output mix under given market conditions (Ali and Byerlee, 1991; Battese, 1992). In addition, many research efforts have been devoted to a better understanding of adoption behavior, considering farm size, education, and market linkages as critical farm household characteristics (Feder et al., 1985). Finally, considerable evidence has been raised to establish the rate of returns to different types of investments in agricultural R&D (Alston et al., 1995) Analytical procedures for a sound analysis of technical change in agriculture are nowadays well established. Partial approaches have been replaced by whole-farm analysis, and frontier techniques are commonly used to identify the yield gap. In addition to mathematical programming methods, econometric and (non)parametric techniques are widely applied to detect underlying causes of yield differences (Coelli, 1995). Dynamic efficiency studies relying on panel data are increasingly used to decompose efficiency differences. New study areas related to issues of biotechnology adoption, integrated pest and nutrient management, and organic farming are addressed with similar techniques. The debate on the role of technology for agricultural and rural development has been gradually shifting in recent years, devoting more attention to (i) aspects of risk management as a key condition for smallholder adoption, (ii) the adaptation of farming systems to major climatic challenges (see Section 5), and (iii) the implications of market linkages for dovetailing farmers' production decisions to consumer demands (see Section 6). The conference papers selected for inclusion in this special issue provide adequate state-of-the-art research regarding the role of technology change. Börner et al. analyze the impact of rainfall and price variability on rangeland management decisions in the South African savanna region. Using stochastic and deterministic simulation models, their results indicate that price policies only have a limited impact for reducing bush encroachment, whereas better timing of animal sales and purchases would yield more pronounced utility effects. Also more effective technologies for fire control are promising measures to encourage sustainable rangeland management. The paper by Diagne and Demont takes a new look at empirical adoption models, providing a detailed analysis of the differences in technology adoption between a treatment and a control group, using propensity score matching to control for unobserved differences. Data from rice farmers in Cote d'Ivoire have been used to show that the potential adoption rates of new rice varieties might have been considerably larger if exposure to new technologies would have been offered to a larger population. The interface between development and environment has been subject to much research, originating through the well-known debates on the Kuznetz curve (Grossmann and Krueger, 1995). In subsequent periods, much attention has been devoted to microeconomic options for reducing environmental externalities, and macroeconomic policies for balancing production and environmental concerns. Recent studies are especially concerned with the management of limited water and energy resources and the remaining biodiversity at local and regional level, and with the implications of carbon and greenhouse gas emissions for climate change at global and local level. Agricultural policies for the environment are also considering new instruments, ranging from public taxation to payments for environmental services. While in Western countries options for rewarding multifunctional agriculture are introduced, in many developing countries (inter)national compensation payments still scarcely reach primary producers. The implementation of efficient and equitable regimes for water tariffs, biodiversity control, and carbon payments still meets numerous institutional constraints related to monitoring, enforcement, and control (Baland et al., 2007). Analytical methods for addressing environmental concerns in agricultural economics are developing rapidly. Starting with traditional cost-benefit analysis, most recent studies now apply some kind of integrated bioeconomic approach that accounts for feedback mechanisms. In addition, regional (watershed) models that include spatial distribution effects are increasingly used. Given the wide number of stakeholders involved in environmental management, new approaches based on multiagency simulation and adaptive behavior have been explored. This also permits us to incorporate implications of resource use for human health and leisure. The conference papers addressing issues of environment and development focus on the political motives for environmental policy. Glebe and Salhofer discuss why the share of agricultural area enrolled in EU agri-environmental programs varies significantly between EU member states. Six key factors prove to affect the extent to which environmental programs are implemented: environmental benefits, opportunity costs of participation, budgetary pressure, the share of program expenditures financed by the EU, the political weight attributed to farmers at the national, and the political influence of each country at the EU level. Making use of feasible generalized least square methods to analyze data regarding four years, the study confirms noncooperative behavior of EU members, i.e., countries that contribute less to the EU budget will ceteris paribus implement more programs. Noell analyzes the degree of self-organization in the Danish pork sector, relying on the complex systems theory. Fluctuations in production and supply are explained by referring to adjustments in technological and organizational structures that lead to dynamic investment equilibria. In a more general sense, understanding of the statistical properties of the system's behavioral variables, together with information regarding their threshold levels and marginal stability conditions, could yield fundamental insights to identify adaptive regimes. Agricultural development is taking place in a market environment, whereas market outlets for agricultural production are strongly consumer led. This implies that—in addition to dietary norms—concerns of food safety and quality receive key attention. Moreover, trade in agricultural commodities is increasingly organized through vertically integrated networks, where (public and private) grades and standards determine prospects for market participation (Reardon and Berdegue, 2002; Swinnen, 2007). Whereas earlier research regarding consumer demand and market integration devotes much attention to price relationships and market outlets, recent studies give emphasis to shifting consumer preferences (i.e., healthy food, GM labeled, environmentally friendly, fair trade) and the related institutional regimes for organizing consistent and reliable food supply. In addition, the role of traders, processors, and retailers in price arbitrage for improving regional market integration (Fafchamps, 2004; Reardon and Timmer, 2005), as well as their functions for upgrading quality standards is nowadays widely acknowledged (World Bank, 2005). Otherwise, large concerns remain whether and how smallholder producers will be able to meet these increasing demands (Page and Slater, 2003). The availability of detailed expenditure panel data sets strongly encouraged research on consumption behavior, and consistent methods for expenditure analysis are now generally used (Deaton, 1997). Analytical methods for value chain analysis rely on interfaces with management and marketing sciences, where experimental methods can be particularly useful for analyzing bargaining options and rent distribution (Gereffi and Korzeniewicz, 1994). The four selected papers dealing with consumer behavior and quality standards provide insights in current approaches for analyzing marketing and purchase decisions. Scatasta, Wesseler, and Hobbs analyze differences in consumers' willingness to pay for GM and non-GM products. This is useful to determine whether there are any consumer benefits from GM labeling. Using a theoretical model based on standard constant elasticity of substitution functions, the importance of the quality effect could be illustrated. The results show that failing to consider the quality effect may indeed lead to an overestimation of benefits from (voluntary or mandatory) GM labeling. Wollni and Zeller look at farmers' benefits from participating in specialty markets and cooperatives, taking the example of coffee marketing in Costa Rica. Facing low prices in the conventional coffee markets, specialty market segments have shown consistent growth over the last decade and exhibit price premiums in international markets. The study identifies the factors that determine farmers' participation in specialized markets and whether participation in these markets leads to higher prices for farmers. A two-stage model is used to analyze farmers' marketing decisions and their effect on the prices received, controlling for the endogeneity bias. Results indicate that farmers participating in the specialty coffee segment do in fact receive higher prices and that participation in cooperatives has a positive impact on the probability that a farmer grows specialty coffee. Efforts to increase participation in the specialty coffee segment and in cooperatives would thus be helpful to lessen some of the hardships brought by low prices in the conventional coffee sector. Srinivasan focuses on malnutrition and dietary norms in food consumption in the United States where obesity is becoming a major health concern. Using a mathematical programming approach to analyze dietary patterns across socio-demographic groups, the paper finds that income or ethnic group characteristics have little influence, whereas education is the key variable for changing toward healthy eating norms. Targeting educational efforts would, therefore, be more effective for changing food intake habits. Finally, the study by Schamel addresses the role of auction markets for specialty food products. Auction prices, trade volume, and value for domestic and foreign origin specialty ham with geographical indications, sold in online auctions in Germany are analyzed. Applying hedonic modeling, potential factors that may influence online bidding behavior and final auction prices are explored. Prices for specialty hams with geographical indications were 20–30% higher. Results indicate a positive auction price effect for weight, bidding activity, and auction length, whereas higher shipping cost and close-to-the-weekend auctions have a negative impact on final price. International trade and regional integration are usually considered as important strategies for economic development. It is, however, increasingly recognized that globalization does not automatically work in favor of less-developed countries (Bardhan et al., 2006). In order to be able to reap the potential comparative advantage, due attention should be given to the conditions under which trade liberalization takes place and the interlinkages among markets. Most recent analyses concerning (inter)national trade focus attention on the requirements of market reforms in Western countries (including the decoupling of farmers support measures), tariff reduction for raw and processed commodities from developing countries, and options for improving regional integration among Southern countries. Well-established analytical tools for analyzing alternative trade regimes are currently available, thus favoring the debate between scientists and policy makers (Hertel, 1997; Ingco and Winters, 2003). The contributions that address trade issues focus on staple and specialty products under contracting and free trade conditions. Minten, Randrianarison, and Swinnen present a case study of vegetables contract farming for exports of vegetables from Madagascar, where strong spillover effects of these trade opportunities on land use are found. Using a matched plot sampling design, the productivity of domestically consumed rice is shown to be far higher on fields that were contracted during the off-season for the production of vegetables. This increase in yields is linked to an increase of soil fertility due to the application of fertilizer and compost, which farmers did not use prior to the contracts. While agricultural output goes up significantly, labor productivity stays the same, suggesting that there is greater labor absorption on existing land. The diffusion of this type of technology at a larger scale throughout Madagascar would, therefore, also substantially decrease incentives to deforestation. The article by Scoppola looks at economies of scale in international grain trade. The paper develops a two-stage duopoly model that considers a private trader and a state trading enterprise competing on a foreign market. Whereas the latter makes use of external agents to export, private firms may choose to internalize international transactions. The model includes different modes of competition and assumptions of homogeneous and differentiated products. The analysis shows that external shocks on export markets may result in changes of market structure and, consequently, of market shares, depending on the initial market structure. Bussolo and colleagues use a panel set of household survey data for Uganda showing that coffee market liberalization followed by a price boom was associated with substantial reductions in poverty. The gains from higher coffee prices accrued to poorer and richer coffee farmers alike. In addition, strong spillovers are found from coffee production to other agriculture and to nonagricultural activities. Poor coffee farmers were able to accommodate the negative price shock, in particular through agricultural diversification. Overall, the case of coffee in Uganda thus lends support to the view that agricultural trade liberalization can be beneficial for the poor. Finally, Rau and van Tongeren address the trade impact of quality standards from the supply side of exporting countries, taking the Polish meat sector as an empirical example. Using a stylized oligopoly model that allows for the coexistence of complying and noncomplying suppliers, two alternative policy options to enhance quality are explored. Simulation results show that a subsidy scheme can be an effective instrument to promote compliance with standards and can be helpful to support upgrading of the exporting country's industry. Current research and academic debates regarding agricultural and rural development show remarkable dynamics after several decades of domination by the “Washington Consensus.” Many papers presented at the 26th IAAE conference take market failures and institutional constraints to development as a starting point for their analysis, paying due attention to governance issues and strategies for reducing transaction costs. In addition, there is also a remarkable continuity in thought and an emerging consensus regarding the importance of growth and investments for socioeconomic development, based on the recognition of the leading role of agriculture for guaranteeing inclusive and sustainable pathways for growth. This leads to the reappraisal of the role of the state and increased attention for the complementarities between public and private investments. The review of the conference papers showed that there are still enormous challenges to the profession, both in terms of thematic areas that are largely neglected, and in terms of the development of new analytical approaches required to address the complexities of hunger and poverty alleviation. Emerging topics for research that certainly deserve more attention are related to the linkages between poverty and health (particularly HIV-AIDS), the intra- and extrahousehold dimensions of exclusion, the complementarities between trade and domestic policies, and the interactions between economic policies, participation, and democracy. In the field of international trade, we found it remarkable to see so few papers on commodity markets and prices, on oligopolies in the international trade and on social standards, including Fair Trade labels. New avenues for promising research tend to be based on interfaces with other related disciplines, particularly with management sciences (in supply chain analysis), with other social sciences (to address the role of social institutions), and with food and environmental sciences (in studies regarding nutrition and the environment).

One of the risks in writing books (and book reviews) on the topic of global climate change is that the ideas presented are obsolete before the paper publications appear. That danger notwithstanding, it is also important to recognize the antecedents of current global-change policy decisions. These volumes, one a traditional print-version hardcover book and the other a free, downloadable handbook (now translated into French), together serve to equip readers for this rapidly evolving field. The 68 authors from 19 countries that contributed 17 chapters and four case studies to Climate Change and Forests (CCF) provide background on the Kyoto Protocol (KP), which will be replaced in 2012 by the new agreement. Foundation for the agreement is outlined in The Little REDD Book (LRB) by representatives of a consortium of 37 scientific institutions in 19 countries that focus on forest canopy research. The new instrument known as REDD (Reduced Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation) apparently will address the failure of the KP to consider the climate change mitigation benefits derived from conserving standing forests. It is hoped that it will also circumvent some of the other limitations of the KP, which are described very clearly in the first half of CCF. The second half of the volume may help rescue tropical forests from where the KP left them with its discussion of the REDD option. Climate Change and Forests provides an overview of the general principles on which the KP replacement mechanism should be constructed. The authors describe the challenges of harmonizing these principles for the diversity of countries where the forests in jeopardy are located. Throughout the book, the architecture of a market-based incentive for forest carbon-emission credits (i.e., baseline definition, monitoring, additionality, permanence, and leakage) is discussed with different levels of detail and in reference to a variety of settings. The chapters are sparsely but nicely illustrated and enriched by helpful footnotes; well-synthesized case studies prepared by on-the-ground experts further enhance the text. The first chapters in CCF set the stage by introducing the policies that connect forestry and related land uses to climate-change mitigation, with emphasis on using market incentives to influence the fates of forests. Several public policy instruments and market incentives are discussed, with emphasis on the clean development mechanism (CDM) and joint implementation (JI), the only components of the KP that specifically deal with trees and carbon through plantations. The succinct analysis by Portela et al. of the conditions that need to be in place for a market-based initiative to succeed in promoting forest conservation (clarity in property rights and legal and regulatory frameworks, credible monitoring and enforcement, and equity) was particularly enlightening. The second part of CCF focuses on the international arena starting with a historical overview on land-use change policies. The other three chapters cover the potential links and conflicts between measures taken to mitigate global climate change and ongoing efforts to protect biodiversity while respecting national sovereignty. After explaining why CDM and JI have delivered so little, ways to avoid their problems are presented (Ebeling). The importance of learning from the KP experience was, for me, an important overall message of the book; if we do not know the history, we are condemned to repeat it. The relevance of the chapter by Scholz and Jung stems precisely from the idea of learning from KP. These authors examine in detail the admittedly limited impacts of CDM and JI in a discussion of their major attributes, advances, and some of the components that could serve as templates during the next commitment period (2012–2022). The section ends with a comparison of the carbon benefits of avoiding deforestation versus biomass energy derived from planting new forests, with due attention to the issues of transparency and leakage. The implications of these analyses for land-use policy making are enormous because they can affect prices of agricultural commodities and promote more forest conversion. The third part of CCF covers the implementation of CDM with particular attention to clarifying its legal and market structures. Locatelli et al. begin by walking readers through a portfolio of CDM afforestation–reforestation projects. They examine the design of CDM projects emphasizing the importance of addressing the architecture of an intervention (i.e., baseline definition, additionality, etc.) before the onset of a project. With regards to the equally important consideration of permanence, Lecocq and Couture discuss the virtues of permanent versus temporary credits from the perspective of the market, particularly the benefits of portfolio diversity. Similarly, who owns the carbon needs to be clarified upfront. Overall, the lack of clear and enforced systems of property rights in developing countries is a hurdle for CDM that will remain for REDD. This barrier rises when one considers the high transaction costs of dealing with multitudes of stakeholders with low institutional and financial capacities in countries with weak governance. These legal complexities are illustrated in a chapter devoted to carbon sequestration options in Chile, which failed to consider the enormous environmental costs of converting a large proportion of native forests into plantations. In addition to these institutional issues, the inherent difficulty but fundamental importance of carbon measuring and monitoring forest carbon stocks and fluxes is addressed in CCF. After all, the credibility of any lasting forest-carbon market mechanism lies in the ability of buyers to discern between true and sustained emissions avoiders and “hot air” producers. The chapter by Pearson et al. clarifies this issue by addressing the trade-offs between accuracy and precision and the importance of being able to estimate changes in emissions attributable to the project. The discussion of carbon stocks and fluxes measurements in reference to additionality and leakage will help readers understand how the attributes of the CDM interact. The chapters in the fourth part of CCF introduce the principles of the avoiding deforestation initiative (RED—note the absence of the D for degradation). Sullivan sets the stage by analyzing the implications of project scales (regional vs. national), policies, and markets on the design of RED. More hands-on information is provided by Mollicone et al., who propose an accounting approach to establish emissions from reduced forest conversion. Their system, which garnered international support and is addressed in LRB, captures the wide range among tropical countries in forest cover and deforestation rates. The chapters by Estrada and Garcia-Guerrero and by Schwartzman and Moutinho describe the details of the deforestation avoidance mechanism in a Latin American scenario. They provide a historical account of the role Latin American countries play in international negotiations, analyze the factors causing unabated rates of forest loss, and explore the important connections between forests and the rural poor. The topic of reducing forest degradation is brought up, but nowhere in the volume does it receive the attention it deserves perhaps because of the perceived monitoring difficulties. But even if degradation is disregarded, the lack of technical capacity and appropriate governance and institutional structures in many developing countries will make implementation of forest-based climate mitigation programs difficult. Streck et al. suggest that some of these impediments can be overcome by using a phased system that integrates goals at several scales (regional and national) and that has the advantage of involving participation of several sectors. The final part of CCF covers voluntary carbon markets. The authors use models from Australia and New Zealand and the experience of several U.S. states to highlight the virtues of the voluntary versus regulatory markets and the prominent role of consumer choices. Until the KP is replaced, voluntary markets will be the only outlet for credits coming from standing forests. Several schemes are analyzed (Hamilton et al.), which differ in coverage and focus (e.g., agriculture, community-based agroforestry). The innovative role of voluntary markets and the potential synergisms with regulated markets under the future convention cannot be ignored. Bottom-line challenges remaining are credit transparency, credibility, and legitimacy. And finally, after being pretty much disregarded throughout the volume, Meizlish and Brand present a clear argument for considering the potential carbon contributions of improved forest management. Among the drawbacks of CCF is a lack of discussion about what is meant by forest, particularly whether natural forests can legitimately be converted into plantations for the cause of carbon. The near-complete disregard of forest degradation and forest management is also disconcerting, given the prominent roles many of the authors are playing in informing, if not directly participating in, international climate-change policy making debates. Given the multitude of authors of CCF (over 60) some repetition was unavoidable, but it never annoyed me. What emerges from reading the entire volume is a cohesive picture of what KP achieved in terms of forest, and how the forthcoming instrument can more effectively connect tropical forest fates with climate change. The foundation provided by CCF is built on quite effectively in LRB. Its structural approach to summarizing a range of governmental and nongovernmental proposals submitted to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change provides an efficient way of conveying information and making useful comparisons of the key elements of REDD proposals (i.e., scope, reference level, benefit distribution, and financing). The format highlights each initiative's strengths and weaknesses and is maintained in the recently updated version (The Little REDD+ Book; LRB+). The REDD+ alludes to a renewed emphasis on conservation and enhancement of carbon stocks. The LRB+ clarifies the issue of leakage and introduces to the debate new insights about equity and fairness. Refreshing for stakeholders in developing countries and elsewhere is the mention of the need for Annex I countries to control emissions. The inclusion of new proposals (of which mention should be made of China as a big player in climate negotiations), the reshaping of old ones, and the clarification of other actors’ actions (e.g., The Prince's Rainforests Project) reinforce the value of the LRB+. Together, LRB+ and CCF provide many insights into the ongoing climate-change policy negotiations and clarify for researchers, policy makers, and the educated public the bottlenecks that need to be cleared if climate-change mitigation is to help maintain forest cover while protecting biodiversity and helping to alleviate poverty. That similarly structured initiatives, such as payments for environmental services (PES), have already had positive impacts on livelihoods makes us cautiously optimistic about REDD. At best, REDD will provide opportunities for institutional renewal, strengthened social institutions, and increased human welfare in developing countries. But no mechanism will be successful unless structural measures are taken to address the causes of forest loss, which vary among regions and countries. After all, no fund or global project can do for tropical forests what the host countries are not willing to do.","citation":"Claudia Romero (2009)","page":"chunk_4_1"}

paradigms of contemporary tourism development issues focus the degree of community participation, long term sustainability and resource sharing. Sustainable tourism is perceived as the acceptable model of tourism development as it maintains an optimal balance of sociocultural, environmental and economical aspects of a destination. Sustainable tourism- Eradication of Poverty (ST-EP) programme of UN suggests that the supply chain of tourism should utilise the local resources, thereby supporting the local economy to maximise the benefits of tourist spending (UNWTO). Various concepts like Community Based Tourism Initiatives (CBTI), Pro-Poor Tourism (PPT) supplemented the resource base for suitable approaches towards sustainable tourism development. Sustainable practices are widely appreciated, because the optimal use of resources. Sikkim is a very small hilly State in India and located in the Eastern Himalayas with a rich biodiversity and formidable physical features. It is bounded by vast stretches of Tibetan Plateaus in the North, the Chumbi Valley of Tibet and the Kingdom of Bhutan in the East, the Kingdom of Nepal in the West and Darjeeling District of West Bengal in the South. The geographical features, amazing scenic landscapes and friendly people welcome tourists. While states like Kerala, Goa, Uttarakhand advance in tourism development, Sikkim is lagging behind in tourist arrivals and local development. Sikkim is the first state in India which came up with a policy of promotion of Ecotourism. Conservation of the nature is given the first priority and accordingly many projects were developed in line with this. But the state could not capitalise the abundance of its resources due to policy matters, poor resource allocation management (in terms finance and local administrative aspects). Though the conceptualisation of community involvement in tourism development programmes was emphasised long back, the utility part is still unaddressed. Present study gives an insight into the course of tourism development in the state. It also investigates the mechanism of better community participation in managing tourism resources of the state. The study is divided into three parts. The first part deals with the potentials of tourism development in Sikkim, second part deals with present policies and tourism development programmes and the third part deals with analytical approach towards developing a possible model for better community empowerment and resource management for sustainable development of tourism.","citation":"P J Shyju et al.

relationships between forests and climate change are complex and multidimensional. Deforestation and forest degradation are now recognised to be a globally significant source of greenhouse gas emissions, and it is asserted that reduction of forest-based emissions may be among the least expensive mitigation options. However, decades of unsuccessful efforts to reverse high rates of deforestation and degradation in the tropics have revealed the fundamental failures of markets, governance and policy that drive forest loss. New initiatives toward ‘Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation’ (REDD) will face similar challenges, but could bring to bear new sources of finance and political will. Forests are also vulnerable to the direct impacts of climate change. Warming temperatures, increased variability of rainfall patterns and increased frequency and severity of extreme weather events will all affect the ability of forests to continue providing goods and services to local communities and to society at large. Because healthy forests are more resilient to climate change, sustainable forest management must be given more emphasis in national adaptation strategies. Forest-related mitigation and adaptation strategies are also inter-linked: the permanence of carbon currently stored in forests is at risk from climate change, with some models predicting significant loss of forests due to climate change impacts. Improved forest management in the interest of climate change mitigation and adaptation offers significant potential for co-benefits. The wealth of biodiversity harboured by tropical forests currently being eroded by deforestation and forest degradation can be conserved through management strategies that include biodiversity as well as carbon storage and adaptation objectives. While there will certainly be trade-offs between efficiency and equity, REDD initiatives provide a potential new source of income for rural communities. Finally, the newly-felt urgency of harnessing forests for climate change mitigation and adaptation could accelerate long-overdue reforms in the institutions and governance mechanisms necessary for sustainable forest management.","citation":"Frances Seymour (2008)","page":"chunk_4_1"}

symposium, organized by Douglas Boucher (Union of Concerned Scientists), “Tropical Deforestation and Climate Change: The Science and the Policy,” was held during the 93rd ESA Annual Meeting at Milwaukee, Wisconsin, Friday, 8 August 2008. Tropical deforestation, the source of ~20% of global greenhouse gas emissions, is both a major concern and an enormous opportunity for the effort to slow global warming and avoid the worst consequences of climate change. The symposium considered this issue from a variety of perspectives, ranging from global policy to on-the-ground implementation, and over time periods ranging from the Archaean to the 21st century. David Schwartzman (Howard University) kicked off the symposium by showing how the interaction of the biota, the atmosphere, and the Earth's temperature is not at all a new question. In fact, it goes back to the very beginning of life on earth, nearly 4 billion years ago, and long before there were forests, trees, or even higher plants. During this period, the overall tendency has been for the earth to cool as its biota has developed, so the current rapid warming represents the reversal of a very long-term trend indeed. Paleozoic seawater is not significantly lighter than the present: direct measurement of fossil seawater from salt inclusions (see Knauth and Roberts). Inference from the geologic record of ancient seawater-altered oceanic crust (ophiolites, their ecologite proxies, greenstones). In addition, new support for this temperature history comes from inferred paleotemperatures derived from resurrected (elongation) protein, consistent with hot Archaean, e.g., cyanobacteria emerging at about 60°C at 2.8 Ga. Schwartzman then explained the biogeochemical carbonate–silicate cycle, an updated version of the Urey reaction, which regulates the long-term climate. The recent paper by Zeebe and Caldeira demonstrates that this long-term cycle, dominated by the weathering sink from the atmosphere/ocean, has regulated the climate in the last 600,000 years through glacial/interglacial variations. Modeling the combined forcings, including the likely variation of volcanic outgassing of carbon dioxide, land area, and solar luminosity since 4 billion years ago, and assuming a hot early Precambrian, gives a variation of biotic enhancement of weathering consistent with a progressive increase to the present inferred value. Studies of lichen weathering give results that are relevant to understanding this progressive evolution of land biota, which is so crucial to a first-order climate cooling from a hot early climate to the present near-glacial regime. The land biota evolved from thermophilic procaryotes in the Archean to the plant-dominated ecosystems for the last 400 million years. Temperature constraint on emergence of major organismal groups. Atmospheric pO2 constraint on macroeucaryotes, including metazoa in the Phanerozoic (see Berner et al.). Atmospheric pO2 constraint on emergence of cyanobacteria in the Archean, of leaves (megaphylls) in the Devonian, and (?) of lichens episodically since the Proterozoic. The explosion of biodiversity since the origin of life some 4 billion years ago, driven by the cumulative increase in habitats, physical, chemical and especially within living organisms and ecosystems since the origin of life. A geophysiology of biospheric evolution, not only on Earth but likewise on Earth-like planets around Sun-like stars. Schwartzman concluded that long-term climatic regulation will not save us from anthropogenic global warming ecocatastrophe, since on shorter time scales positive feedbacks play a stronger role. Therefore tropical deforestation poses a real threat as a driver of climate change and biodiversity loss. In contrast to the first-order trend of climatic cooling for the last 4 billion years, we are now witnessing very rapid anthropogenic global warming, and need to act, now! Fear that inclusion would allow major emitters off the hook at home Leakage—the concern that if you protect one patch of forest in a country, deforestation could just move next door Confusion about the dual role of forests as carbon sinks and emission sources Lack of confidence in ability to accurately monitor deforestation and estimate emissions. However, the negotiations for a new climate protocol now do include reducing emissions from deforestation in developing countries (REDD) as a key element. This new interest was stimulated by an innovative proposal by the governments of Papua New Guinea and Costa Rica at the December 2005 negotiations in Montreal, and the current negotiating process aimed at agreement on a global climate protocol in Copenhagen in December 2009, has REDD as one of its principal emphases. Several important issues will need to be resolved to reach agreement on REDD at Copenhagen. They include questions of scale, baselines, scope and the financing mechanisms. Scale refers principally to whether accounting and compensation should be done on the national scale (countries that reduce their overall emissions receive compensation) or on the project level (e.g., emissions reductions are counted and compensated at smaller scales, such as parks and sustainable development projects). The baseline question is whether a country's deforestation and emissions rates over a recent period, or their current forest carbon stock, should be used as the standard against which changes are accounted. The scope issue concerns what kinds of efforts, besides clear deforestation, should be included in the agreement. Other possibilities include forest degradation (carbon loss without canopy elimination), the maintenance of current carbon stocks, and regrowth and increase of carbon stocks. The financing options include carbon market credits, voluntary contributions, a levy on emissions trading, separate markets, and many other possibilities. All these issues will need to be agreed on, to reach a successful outcome in the negotiations. Science has been prominent in the REDD debate, and there has been considerable progress on questions important to the negotiations. Much of the early debate centered on technical issues, such as whether deforestation, biomass, and emissions could be measured accurately, how to distinguish natural and anthropogenic effects on forest carbon stocks, and how to combine remote sensing with ground-based forest inventory data. Now, many of these issues are seen as resolvable, and the debate is moving to the policy implications of some of these questions. There will be a series of negotiating sessions and workshops over the next year, leading to the Copenhagen conference (December 2009) at which a successor to the Kyoto Protocol should be adopted. REDD can be an important component of that new agreement, with enormous positive potential for climate, conservation and sustainable development. Dana Roth (USDA Forest Service International Programs) discussed the increased scientific and technical capacity to address tropical deforestation and related problems, and the role of the Forest Service in helping tropical nations to develop that capacity. The Service's International Programs work in foreign countries to promote sustainable forest management and biodiversity conservation, tapping into the agency's wide range of expertise to link the skills of the field-based staff of the USFS with partners overseas to address the most critical natural resource issues and concerns. For example, they are working with the Honduran Forest Service to develop planning tools and inventory methods for volumes in pine forests, which are overestimated by current methods. Following the requirements of CITES, the U.S. and Honduran Forest Services are cooperating to inventory big-leaf mahogany (Swietenia macrophylla) and provide the basis for monitoring its population and managing it sustainably. These kinds of information are required for a “Non-Detriment Finding,” which in turn is required under CITES for Honduras to be able to export the species. Many questions must be addressed in order to achieve these goals. How many mahogany trees are there and what is their distribution? What are the growth and mortality rates? Are they replacing themselves? What factors play a role in regeneration? What is the distribution of structure or age classes and how is it changing? These questions in turn have suggested others: Is mahogany a rare species and can we use rare species methodologies? Are research findings from Mexico and Brazil (genetic diversity, silvicultural techniques to enhance regeneration, etc.) applicable and relevant to Honduras? What if we find that stocks are too low to continue harvesting in this area? How do you provide support to communities and other concessionaires to make better determinations on how they manage, whether they should continue harvesting, and what are the implications, especially given the intensity of illegal logging? The Forest Service is also working with Mexico on disaster preparedness and fire prediction. These activities were stimulated by the suite of hurricanes (Wilma, Stan, etc.) in 2005, after which it was important to prioritize critical areas and assess conditions predisposing to high fire risk in the following dry season (January 2006). The Mexican agency CONAFOR implemented a program to increase fire awareness in the key areas where risk was high, as well as other measures to address fuel loads, and to model climate for a better analysis of predisposing conditions. In the 2007 and 2008 dry seasons, the predictions of the team proved accurate for the most part, and the state of Quintana Roo and the federal government were prepared with key interventions to minimize the impacts. A similar situation was created when Hurricane Felix hit the North Atlantic coast of Nicaragua in early September 2007, showing the applicability of methods developed in one country for applications in others. For several Central American and Caribbean countries, global warming is a high priority. They are eager for scientific knowledge about climate change, and want to improve their capacity to address risks associated with possible hotter and dryer climates in the future. Some of the methods developed for disaster preparedness will be useful in climate change adaptation as well. Cocoa agroforestry systems in Central America provide ecosystem services and habitat benefits, but farmers rarely profit from these services. They help conserve biological diversity as a shade system, providing habitat for many wildlife species. Current research, including work of the USFS with CATIE and North Carolina State University, is assessing their potential as corridors for wildlife. Cocoa farmers are among the poorest farmers in the region, and in order not to perpetuate land clearing/incursion into protected areas, they need incentives to not clear. This work attempts to link conservation of biological diversity with economic development for small farmers. Identifying problem/key questions in cooperation with key actors; asking questions about why it is a problem and how they would propose approaching it. Incorporating good planning—always. It saves time and money. Planning often gets cut when time is short. We try to build capacity on planning process in all of our programs. Trying to understand local context; what resources are available and can be mobilized. Is there a champion? What might be the different methods to build capacity locally? Monitoring impact: Do we have a framework for monitoring and evaluation? Is the outcome what we wanted? Are we asking the right questions? Whom/what have we left out? Disseminating/sharing information; training the trainer. How do we build sustainability? What are the next steps? How can we learn from our mistakes? I've found over the years that in order to make research/interventions relevant, I needed to spend a lot more time understanding the problem at hand. Often there is a policy context which needs to be understood; the issues are rarely only scientific. Consensus-building and flexibility and patience are important. Elizabeth Shapiro (University of California-Berkeley) explained how, as international climate change negotiators struggle to define the most effective way to design programs to compensate for Reduced Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation (REDD), detailed on-the-ground studies of Mexico's Payment for Ecosystem Services programs can provide useful lessons. Some of the largest and most elaborate payment for avoided deforestation programs to date are Mexico's federal Payment for Ecosystem Services–Hydrological (PSA-H) and the Program for the Development of Markets for the Ecosystem Services of Carbon Sequestration, the Derivatives of Biodiversity, and to Promote the Introduction and Improvement of Agroforestry Systems (PSA-CABSA). The Mexican National Forestry Commission (CONAFOR) administers both programs. The PSA-H program was first implemented in 2003, followed shortly after in 2004 by the PSA-CABSA program. Between 2003 and 2007, the two programs have signed contracts with landowners for over US$ 260 million, enrolling over 2 million hectares of land. Shapiro's analysis is based on interviews conducted between October 2005 and July 2008 with key actors involved in the programs' development and implementation and on analysis of project documents and international policy papers. Any payment for an avoided deforestation scheme must include certain basic elements. One of these is establishing a baseline deforestation rate and monitoring change. Mexico has been lucky in that it could draw on a pre-existing forest cover monitoring program that combined remote sensing data with grounded ecological sampling. Even with this advantage, monitoring has still been a significant expense. The payment scheme for the Mexican programs was set according to the constraints and nature of each type of ecosystem service: with specific per-hectare payments for hydrological services or perton payments for carbon sequestration, and payments for biodiversity conservation based on estimated project costs. To promote permanence and conditionality, CONAFOR signs contracts for 5 years, and annual payments are reduced if deforestation is detected on enrolled land. Ensuring access, transparency, and equity in targeting and selecting participants has been a constant challenge. In response to these problems, CONAFOR has begun to regulate the quality of and funding for intermediary organizations, simplify the rules of operation, and conduct significant outreach and education. Defining the role of the state has been one of the larger issues to confront the Mexican PES programs. CONAFOR's original vision was to provide start-up funds to be replaced with markets for ecosystem services after five years. As the program has evolved, they have in some cases also begun to serve as broker or as a permanent buyer of ecosystem services, where market demand is insufficient. Another issue has been to balance national priorities with international market demands. There has been significant external political pressure to include poverty alleviation goals. This has to an extent been accomplished through targeting areas with high degrees of marginalization and limiting total land area enrolled per participant. The programs use a point system in the selection process that assigns higher scores to participants who fulfill social or secondary environmental goals (e.g. inside a protected area, area of high biodiversity, indigenous communities, etc.). Since their inception, the Mexican programs have undergone a continuous process of change and adaptation in response to problems and barriers in implementing these innovative mechanisms to promote avoided deforestation. All in all, the symposium showed the need, the potential, and the challenges of reducing greenhouse gas emissions from tropical deforestation. It will be a fundamental part of the effort to slow global warming, which is a reversal of a trend in earth's history going back 4 billion years. But reaching a successful international agreement, developing the capacity to undertake the necessary activities, and successfully implementing programs on the ground, will present major challenges. Nevertheless, experience to date shows that it can be done, with major benefits for the climate, biodiversity, and sustainable development.","citation":"Doug Boucher et al.

paper presents lessons from environmental management in Bulgarian agriculture for Central Asian countries. Comparative institutional analysis is employed to evaluate potential of diverse governing modes to deal with environmental problems and risks, protect absolute and contracted eco-rights, stimulate eco-investment, intensify and coordinate eco-activities. Firstly, we assess efficiency of market, private and public modes in Bulgarian agriculture and identity major environmental challenges. Next we withdraw lessons how positive and negative experiences from Bulgarian transition could be used in modernization of environmental management in Central Asia. Post-communist transformation of Bulgarian agriculture has been associated with relaxation of general environmental pressure but also brought about significant new problems such as degradation and contamination of farmland, pollution of surface and ground waters, loss of biodiversity etc. Central Asian countries should adapt Bulgarian experience to their specific economic, institutional and natural environment. More particularly, they have to modernize institutional structure introducing new eco-rights, redistributing rights on natural resources, liberalizing eco-activities, and improving systems of enforcement of eco-rights. Next, they have to apply integral approach in governing of public support, research, education and extension programs embracing economic, social, environmental etc. aspects of agrarian sustainability. They also are to select more effective modes for public intervention (regulation, assistance, financing, partnership with private sector) and enhance direct public involvement is environmental preservation and improvement. Furthermore, different forms of public and international assistance should incorporate environmental measures in dominating modes of farming governance in each country; take into consideration all advantages, disadvantages and impacts of individual forms; commit to and effectively fund achievement of long-term goals; secure equal access of all type farms to support programs; and involve farmers and other stakeholders in program management and implementation.","citation":"Hrabrin Bachev (2007)","page":"chunk_4_1"}

paper will discuss preparations by EWRI and IWR for the 5th World Water Forum. Several potential WWF5 themes are being considered. Currently, the WWF5 sessions are divided into several broad thematic areas, including: 1. Water Security Adapting to Climate Change and Risk Management Protecting Resources, Livelihoods and Biodiversity Financing Water Infrastructure and Services; 2. Water Management and Governance Improving Management of Water Services and Resources Improving Water Governance Innovation and Water Technologies Equity, Education and Ethics; 3. Water Use and Impacts Health, Sanitation and Water Supply Food Security, Water for Food, and Ecosystems Water for Energy — Energy for Water; 4. Basin Management and Development; 5. Wild Card Themes. Although planning for US particpation is just beginning, EWRI has engaged both the AWRA and Corps of Engineers in discussions about our possible approach. One rich source of material may be the AWRA sponsored US Water Policy Dialogue in possible combination with Canadian and Mexican policy views. ASCE has taken positions in several areas of water policy as well.

August 2006 Memphis, Tennessee Members present: Nancy Grimm (President), Jerry Melillo (Past-President), Alan Covich (President-Elect), Gus Shaver (Vice President for Science), Carol Brewer (Vice President for Education and Human Resources), Richard Pouyat (VP for Public Affairs), Bill Parton (VP for Finance), David Inouye (Secretary), Shahid Naeem (Member-at-Large), Dee Boersma (Member-at-Large), Dennis Ojima (Member-at-Large), and Meg Lowman (incoming VP for Education and Human Resources). Norm Christensen (incoming President-Elect) arrived 2:30 pm. Staff present: Katherine McCarter (Executive Director), Cliff Duke (Director of Science), Elizabeth Biggs (Director of Finance), Fran Day (Director of Development), Jason Taylor (Director of Education), Nadine Lymn (Director of Public Affairs), Sue Silver (Editor), David Baldwin (Managing Editor), David Gooding (Associate Managing Editor) Guests present (6 August 2006): Steve Chaplin (Co-Chair Meetings Committee), Edward Johnson (Editor-in-Chief, ESA Bulletin), Kiyoko Miyanishi (Co-Chair, Meetings Committee), and Don Strong (Editor-in-Chief, Ecology and Ecological Monographs). Staff: Michelle Horton (Meetings Manager) and Devon Rothschild (Program Assistant) I. ROLL CALL (9:02 am) A) The GB unanimously adopted the proposed agenda. B) Minutes from the May 2006 Governing Board meeting were adopted with one editorial correction. II. REPORTS A) Report of the President (Grimm) President Grimm highlighted 5 areas of activity: 1) Regional activities (Regional Knowledge Partnerships), and the pilot Southeast Project (update from Alan and Jerry later on). 2) Growth in membership. On track to reach 10,000, perhaps at this meeting. 3) Education. There are many SEEDS activities for 40 student participants at this meeting. A proposal has been submitted for a SEEDS For Teachers program. Remaining funds from the Ford Foundation Mexico meeting grant are supporting five graduate students from South America to make presentations at this meeting. 4) ESA representing the ecological science community. The goal is to be a voice to funding agencies, to foster initiatives that require an integrated and coherent community effort; e.g., meetings with federal agencies (USDA's CREES program last May). Science Office has been busy (more later). A special session on Monday with representatives of USDA, NSF, and NASA on a panel, and initiatives from the ecological community (LTER-based or initiated programs). 5) Publications review. A charge has been developed for Board approval at this meeting, to form an Ad-Hoc “Publications Review Committee.” B) Report of the Executive Director and staff 1) Executive Director (McCarter) The Annual Meeting will probably be a little smaller than expected (possibly 2800 to 3000 vs. 3200 expected), but is expected to achieve budget expectations. The new team has worked well during the build-up to the meeting. Web site redesign is proceeding, with staff reviewing and rewriting text. 2) Public Affairs (Lymn) Annie Drinkard has been working hard to get media coverage of the meeting: reporters from the Nature office in London, Mother Jones, a local TV station, Smithsonian Magazine, etc. Board members are invited to the Rapid Response Team lunch. The King County (Washington State) executive, Ron Simms, will be speaking at the Opening Plenary. As an experiment this year, Anne Bartuska will give a talk on environmental justice at the Anointed Temple of Praise, a popular African-American church 15 miles from the Convention Center. A wetlands course on the Hill is being offered for congressional staffers for 2 days during the August recess, with a field trip on the third day to the Smithsonian's Environmental Research Center. 3) Publications (Baldwin) Submissions continue to increase ~10%/yr, average paper length and acceptance rates have gone down, so there has been no increase in the backlog of unpublished papers. First ever supplement for Ecology was published in conjunction with the July issue this year. A small-scale experiment with open access (one article per issue) was started with the July issue of Ecology; this is not being advertised widely yet, but is a trial to see how this works. An attempt will be made to implement “mini-subscriptions,” allowing individuals to purchase numbers of on-line articles in quantities of 1, 5, 10, 20 over a year or two (using the Geological Society's program as a model). 4) Frontiers (Silver) The new impact factor for the journal is 4.745, placing it second among environmental science journals and sixth among ecological journals. The September issue will be the one focused on China, and will be open access. The whole issue may be translated (abstracts already are); 300 copies will be sent to authors to distribute, and it may be made available at the May 2007 meeting in China. Other special topic issues, including one from the ESA meeting in Merida, Mexico, are coming up. 5) Administration (Biggs) The fiscal year just ended with a positive balance. For the coming fiscal year, $50,000 less is budgeted than last year as income from the Annual Meeting will be less than Montreal, and the bump in enrollment that typically accompanies the meeting may not quite get us to 10,000 members this year. 6) Education (Taylor) A fourth CD of Teaching Issues and Experiments in Ecology was published this year. SEEDS (now in its 10th year) had a field trip to the Konza Prairie LTER site in June. The largest number of applications ever received came in this year for attendance at the Annual Meeting, and about 40 ESA members are serving as mentors for these students. Board members are encouraged to attend the Diversity Luncheon. The student coordinator will be leaving for a graduate program this fall and interviews are ongoing for a replacement. 7) Science (Duke) About 350 people attended the workshop on agricultural air quality in June. The sustainability science workshop funding has been approved, for next spring in the Northeast. The data registry workshop occurred last month. The NBII collaboration on a web site about pollination is proceeding. The cooperative agreement (a 3-year project) with them could lead to a variety of other collaborative efforts. In September a project will begin to produce a series of papers about ecological services provided by agricultural wetlands (NRCS collaboration); plan is to publish these as an open-access supplement to Ecological Applications. Involvement in 2007 nitrogen meeting in Brazil is proceeding (primarily publication support – maybe a special issue of Ecological Applications). Two Board members are working with Cliff on the issues of sustainability science (Shaver) and data sharing (Grimm). Another potential issue is the ecological effects of warfare (Boersma). ESA blog will be initiated with the new Web site. There was discussion about how the blog will be monitored / controlled. 8) Development (Day) Frontiers will become a focus for funding after this Annual Meeting. SEEDS is progressing well, with an upcoming focus on ecology clubs and an international component. Collaboration with the Science Office will include focusing on nitrogen and ecological effects of war. An upcoming survey will help in development of both membership and Frontiers funding. In the coming year a series of “friend-raising” events will be held around the country to try and cultivate major donors (D.C. as a prototype, possibly Boston, Atlanta, Santa Fe). Knowledge Partnerships for the Southeast are also in progress. It was noted that almost all Board members contributed to the Millennium Fund. C) Report of the Vice President for Finance (Parton) The unaudited year-end statement was presented. Grant revenue was more than expected, and interest and dues income were greater than anticipated. Bottom line is that we are able to add $281,000 to the unrestricted fund (reserve) category. As subscription numbers continue to erode, we may need to find a way to endow the journals to support their continued publication and to deal with publishing issues such as open access. Investment update: the past 3 months haven't done so well (lost ~1%), but we are still up ~7% over the past year. We have ~60% in equities (mostly in mutual funds), 40% in bonds. III. DISCUSSION ITEMS/ACTIONS A) Fiscal Year 2006–2007 ESA budget (McCarter) 1) Approval of proposed budget The only change since the draft was presented in May is a change from 4% to 5% (2% cost of living, 3% merit) for staff salary increases. A motion is moved, seconded, and approved: The Board approves the proposed budget of $6,025,838. 2) Long-range planning grants At-large members of the Board helped to review the proposals from Chapters and Sections. This system worked well, and will be continued with Dennis Ojima as Chair. Listing of previous awards on the Web site might be a good way to provide some guidance to future applicants. 3) Committee funds These have typically been used for meetings of four committees each year: Science, Public Affairs, and Education, plus one other that changes from year to year. $5600 per committee is allocated. This year the Board agreed to fund a meeting of the Ad Hoc Publications Review Committee. 4) Board initiative funds There is a list of 10 potential recipients for this $20,000 budget category (which comes from the Millennium Fund). Budgets were estimated for each of the 10 ideas, and five (totaling $20,200) were discussed as possible candidates. The Board moved, seconded, and approved: The Board approves the budget for Board strategic funds, including: $3000 for dissemination of Profiles of Ecologists; $2000 for an ESA intern to write the undergraduate survey report; $5600 for a second meeting of the Special Ad-Hoc Publications Review Committee; $5600 for a planning meeting in Athens, Georgia for Knowledge Partnership workshops; $5600 toward the documentation of ESA history. President Grimm suggested that we need a standardized time of year to make and discuss these kinds of ideas, and proposed presenting ideas in November, budgeting them in May, and then approving them in August. 5) Discussion of Council presentation VP Parton will present the budget, discuss where the income came from, major expenditures, the goal of raising $2 million (or $5 million) for a Reserve Fund. B) Reserve funds (Parton/McCarter/Biggs) It would be prudent to have a full year's funding available as a reserve, particularly in view of the small size of our endowment. A fringe benefit of this would be the interest income from such a reserve once it is achieved. A motion is moved, seconded, and approved: The Board approves the goal of establishing a reserve fund of $5,000,000. C) Conflict of interest policy (Day) A motion is moved, seconded, and approved with one abstention: The Board approved the proposed conflict of interest policy. D) Guidelines for evaluating corporate funders/list of corporations (Day) A motion is moved, seconded, and approved: The Board amended the current “Corporate and Commercial Support or Donations Policy by changing point #7 to read “When soliciting funds the ESA will consider evidence of commitment to environmental sustainability, biodiversity, and development of new applications of ecological science. The Development Committee will screen prospects and periodically consult with the Governing Board on potential donors.” E) Knowledge partnerships (Melillo/Covich/staff) The Southeast has been chosen as a pilot region for establishing these knowledge partnerships. To develop the concept, a set of two workshops is proposed, the first a meeting to plan the program for a larger workshop. The second meeting would bring a large number of stakeholders and scientists together. The first meeting will occur this November. The proposed Center for Progressive Land Use, which may receive legacy funding with the assistance of Governor Bush, may be associated with this effort as one of a small number of core subjects for the workshops. How will success of the program be judged? Indicators will help to attract financial support. We hope that the model from this pilot project (the Southeast) will be a model for similar efforts in other parts of the country. F) Integrative Science for Society and the Environment (Grimm) A draft report, “Integrative Science for Society and Environment: A Strategic Research Plan,” prepared by the Research Initiatives Subcommittee of the LTER Planning Process Conference Committee, has been unofficially submitted to NSF and is presented to the Board. This is one of two outcomes from an award made to LTER to plan for initiatives within and beyond LTER. President Grimm requests feedback from Board members about potential involvement by ESA in this effort. There is some feeling that although the general idea is good, and that this broad perspective is something that ESA should be concerned and involved with, this document may be too focused on LTER instead of the general ecological community. President Grimm will take the comments presented back to the authors. They will revise the document, and ask that ESA consider writing a letter in support of the effort; a draft letter will be presented for consideration at the November meeting. G) Yearly public policy priorities (Pouyat/Lymn) The list of policy priorities has been vetted by the Public Affairs Committee. The consensus is that this list and the process for keeping it current are appropriate. H) Data sharing update (Duke/Baldwin/Grimm) The 2004 Society Summit of 12 organizations was an effort to identify common ground in interest/need for data sharing. NSF funded three workshops—on data registries (held last month), data centers, and obstacles to data sharing. There were 16 societies and 9 other organizations represented at the July 2006 workshop. Board members were encouraged to pass on recommendations to Cliff for potential participants in the two future workshops. I) ESA top 10 list Is there something of this nature that ESA should do to draw attention to particular issues? Maybe published annually in Frontiers? Other suggestions include: a top 10 list of facts that ecologically literate citizen should know, a list of the top 10 papers each year about ecological science, a list of the top 10 cited ecological papers each year, top 10 ecological concepts each year. VPs are requested to take these ideas into consideration. J) Feedback from outgoing Board members (Melillo/Brewer/Naeem/Boersma) The outgoing members all expressed positive feelings about their service on the Board and appreciation for the quality and hard work of the staff. K) Annual Meeting schedule Board members reviewed their obligations during the Memphis meeting. EXECUTIVE SESSION L) Memphis meeting (Miyanishi, guest) The meeting is smaller, similar to what we had before Portland; meetings in the East tend to be smaller, and this is not a joint meeting. Review of proposals and abstracts went well. Only seven proposals for Organized Oral Sessions, but seven Symposium proposals ended up as OOSs too; this is the third year we have had OOSs, and Board members are encouraged to spread the word about this form of special session for future meetings. Registration might end up about 2800. M) 2008 Meeting theme Program Chair for the 2008 meeting, Lou Gross, proposed a theme for the meeting. Proposed theme is “Enhancing ecological thinking through research/education linkages.” There is some sentiment that this could be improved to make it more enticing. Suggestions include “Ecology for society,” and “Emerging frontiers in ecological literacy.” Lou Gross will be asked to consider these ideas and report back to the Board in November. N) Future meetings (Chaplin, guest) 1) Annual Meeting site (2011) Two contenders were Austin, Texas and Charlotte, North Carolina; looking for something in the Southeast, following San Jose, Milwaukee, Albuquerque, and Pittsburgh. Steve Chaplin, Katherine McCarter, Michele Horton, and Tricia Crocker visited both Austin and Charlotte, and found the former the most suitable for ESA (a casual, laid-back attitude, lots of music and restaurants within a few blocks of the meeting venue). A motion is moved, seconded, and approved: The Board approves the proposal to hold the 2011 Annual Meeting in Austin. 2) Program chair/Local host issues We still need a Local Host Committee chair in Albuquerque, where we also met in 1997. Pittsburgh-area ecologists will meet soon to help identify a Chair for that meeting. O) Publications charge (Grimm) The Publications Committee was asked last year to report to the Board with questions and issues pertaining to the Society's publications. Their ideas have been used to create a charge for a Special Ad-hoc Publications Review Committee. There is some sentiment that we should de-emphasize the issue of open electronic access, as there are not many commercial or private publications moving in this direction at present. Ideas are suggested for the categories of participants who would be useful for a Review Committee (a graduate student, a librarian, Chair of Publications Committee, a Board member, etc.). Grimm and Covich will work on appointing a committee, which will receive staff support from Liz Biggs, David Baldwin, and Sue Silver. The Publications Review Committee charge was approved with the modification that consideration of open access issues be listed as a single item rather than three items. P) NEON update (Melillo) NEON is evolving, and some of the evolutionary steps are substantial, such as significant structural changes (new CEO, restructured Board), and changed emphasis on experimental work. The ESA will continue to offer its assistance in communicating with the ecological community (ESA membership). Q) Meetings with Editors-in-Chief 1) Ecology/Ecological Monographs (Strong, guest) Major demands on his time included: looking at and assigning 1400 manuscripts to about 100 editors (some ad-hoc); recruiting and retaining editors; responding to protests by authors (about 100 last year; about 10% of decisions were reversed). The editorial process seems to be going well from his perspective and that of authors. 2) ESA Bulletin (Johnson, guest) Johnson is still looking for ways to take advantage of the digital format (e.g., pictures, videos, models). He'd like someone who could suggest Web sites of interest to ecologists, and hopes that more use will be made of the Emerging Technologies column. 3) Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment (Silver) There was some discussion about how we might use Frontiers to make connections to the business community, building upon its success to date with policy makers and researchers. R) Position paper/position statement updates 1) Fire management (Ojima) Reviews are in and back to authors. The revision must still come to the Board, then to the membership, before being issued as an official statement of the Society. There is an existing Fact Sheet on Fire. The paper in progress is essentially a review paper, and perhaps impenetrable to policy makers. We may need a category of paper in between in size (e.g., three pages), accessible to policy makers. 2) Nuclear energy (Pouyat) Currently in revision. 3) Invasives paper (Grimm) Barney Caton wrote a response to the paper that will be published in the ESA Bulletin, and Ed Johnson has asked whether the Board would like to respond. Grimm requested that David Lodge (author of the position paper) develop a response with the other original authors, and including Board member Dee Boersma. S) New business Thanks to President Grimm and the departing Board members for their service. Meeting is adjourned at 12:30 pm on 6 August 2006.","citation":"David W.

It would be interesting to know what brought them into science. I'd hazard a guess that it was some childhood influence—probably an inspiring teacher. Indeed, the government's advertising campaign some years ago, ‘Thank a teacher’, resonated with many of us.Many pupils today never encounter an expert and enthusiastic science teacher. Too few new specialist teachers are joining the profession, especially in physics and maths, to replace those now retiring. Until a few years ago, the Royal Society wasn't much involved with pre-university education. But it now concerns us greatly. We've convened a group with the acronym SCORE (for science community partnership supporting education), chaired by Sir Alan Wilson, to coordinate views from the main learned societies—physics, chemistry and biosciences. This initiative follows the successful precedent of ACME (the Advisory Committee on Mathematics Education), a committee established five years ago to act as a single voice for the mathematical community. We hope these Royal Society initiatives will lead to more effective input into education policy.To meet the government's targets of increasing the percentage of teachers qualified to teach physics, newly recruited physics graduates won't be enough. Supplementary measures are needed. Biology teachers can be given extra expertise in physics. Mature professionals should be encouraged to consider a move into teaching from a career in research, industry or the armed forces. Also, more can be done to encourage scientists based in universities to spend time in schools and vice versa.Very young children have a natural interest in science—whether focused on space, dinosaurs or tadpoles. But we're not so good at converting youthful enthusiasms into sustained engagement with science in the 11–16 age range.This is especially serious here in England. In our unduly specialized education system, those who are turned off science by 16 years of age will drop it. They thereby foreclose most options of studying it at university.Practical work in school laboratories is not always adequate—at least according to the hard-hitting recent report of the House of Lords Select Committee. We would also like pupils to have more chance to do some sort of genuine scientific investigation or fieldwork.It is surprising, however, how little is agreed about what teaching methods are most effective. As a specific contribution, the Royal Society plans to set up some new fellowships for educational research, with similar status to our URFs (University Research Fellows—the Society's flagship programme supporting 300 of tomorrow's leaders in science). This is one way in which modest resources, backed by the expertise and standing of the Society, could make a distinctive difference.Schools should not just focus on the education of would-be professionals. Also of concern is the low educational and skill level of too many disadvantaged pupils—and, even worse, their low ambitions.But there's another reason for emphasizing basic scientific literacy. Today's young people will grow up in a world where ever more political choices—on energy, environment, medicine and bioethics—have a scientific dimension. For an informed public debate, everyone needs at least some feel for science—some engagement with its concepts. We welcome the commitment of Ian Pearson, the new science minister, to the encouragement of public engagement with science—something to which the Royal Society is itself strongly committed.(As a parenthetical note, let me mention the Royal Society's study on university education beyond 2015, to be published next month. Our earlier report, A degree of concern, clarified the numbers of graduates in various subjects. The ‘headline figures’ show, for example, that the numbers reading ‘biological sciences’ have risen sharply. But only about 4000 a year graduate in straight ‘biology’. Much the largest subject in the ‘biological sciences’ group is psychology (around 11 000 per year); the second largest, with over 5000 graduates a year, is sports science.)Research fundingThe demarcations between government departments were altered after the July reshuffle; there is now a separate schools ministry, the Department for Children, Schools and Families (DCSF), with responsibility for teachers and curriculum. The changes do, however, bring under another single ministry, the Department for Innovation, Universities and Skills (DIUS), three domains of special interest to the Society: higher education, the research councils, and the Chief Scientific Advisor's office. We have established good contacts with John Denham and his ministerial team.Incidentally, a casualty of the revamping of ministries has been the Select Committee on Science and Technology. This committee has produced some excellent reports; its respected chair, Phil Willis has become a good friend of the Society's. The Committee's remit spanned many departments, and it was able to accommodate this breadth. It would be a real loss if, in its new downgraded status of subcommittee, it were unable to maintain an effective role—such wide-ranging matters should not be left to the House of Lords committee, excellent though that is.The Comprehensive Spending Review settlement gave the Research Councils, overall, an annual increase of about 2.7% in real terms—a more generous deal than most parts of government received. But the move towards covering full economic costs eroded this, so it's not clear that volume can be maintained. And the new Science and Technology Facilities Council (STFC) starts life with a legacy of overcommitment, with potentially serious consequences that we are watching closely.A second funding stream for university research comes via the Higher Education Funding Councils. Our American colleagues are bemused by this ‘dual support system’. I tell them that, for all our gripes about the Research Assessment Exercise, it is better than the US system, where professors must hustle for grants to meet even basic academic needs. I'll say no more about the Research Assessment Exercise—a much over-discussed topic in all university common rooms—except to note that a group chaired by Adrian Smith will be guiding the Society's views on what should replace it after 2008.Whatever the funding system is, it must avoid introducing perverse incentives. Up till now, there has, for instance, been a disincentive for applied work, and for popular writing and outreach.We know that a few universities attract the lion's share of research funding—from all sources. That's likely to be true whatever system prevails. But despite the trend towards concentration, there's at least one top-rated department in more than 50 of our universities. I think it's crucial to retain a system that allows excellence to sprout and bloom anywhere in the university system.Let me give an example. Leicester University is world-class in genetics and in space science. That wasn't planned. Enterprising young researchers in these two fields happened to have jobs there, and the system that prevailed in the 1970s allowed them to build up major research groups. And Sir Philip Cohen, who played a key role in developing the acclaimed biomedical excellence of Dundee, is on record as saying that he would have had more difficulties were he starting today.Of course the healthiest situation is one where funding is not only more generous but also comes from a variety of sources—public and private—allocated by different criteria. The USA benefits from a far stronger tradition of private funding. In this country there is substantial non-governmental funding of biomedical research—above all from the Wellcome Trust—but the physical sciences are more dependent on public funding. The Society itself makes a modest contribution, which we hope gradually to enlarge.I've so far focused parochially on the UK—and on a modest time horizon. All universities—both their teaching and their research—will need to change if we are to exploit new technologies. People everywhere in the world will be immersed in a cyberspace that is ever more information-rich and sophisticated. Scientists anywhere—including skilled amateurs—will be able to download from a ‘virtual observatory’, or from a library of genome data.And the sociology of research is changing. There are more collaborative papers (many with overseas authors); many of us use large facilities (such as the recently opened Diamond Light Source facility). Enhanced computer power is transforming how we do our science. We can handle huge volumes of data. Scientists can do ‘numerical experiments’ where they cannot do real experiments, and address questions such as: What do pollutants do to the world's climate? How do financial markets react to various externalities? And so forth. As an astronomer, I can crash stars and galaxies together in a ‘virtual universe’ in a computer. The map of learning is itself changing as knowledge expands; developments are often fastest on the interfaces between traditional subjects.But whatever happens, one thing is surely clear. If the UK is to maintain a leading role in science, it needs enough of the right people.Science must attract a good share of the talented entrants to universities. But that is not enough. It also matters where those who are well educated in science end up. Even if the educational pathways are open and smooth, scientific careers won't attract young people unless they have a positive perception of the profession. Most Fellows feel, I'm sure, that academia, public service or private industry has offered them challenging opportunities. It's crucial that enough of tomorrow's scientists, medics and engineers should feel the same way. Otherwise this country won't play its part in meeting the great twenty-first-century challenges.In my Cambridge college I asked a group of final-year engineering students what their career plans were. Only one was going to be an engineer—the rest were heading for the city or management consultancy.It's fine that some take those paths (provided, at least, that they don't think they're thereby getting closer to the ‘real world’!). But isn't the overwhelming flight of talent from manufacturing a cause for concern? Anecdotal accounts suggest that many large companies don't offer the real ‘high flyers’ enough scope, early on, to make a mark, show initiative, and achieve a financial premium, to the extent that the financial sector does. The solution lies in the hands of the senior management—and of bodies such as the Confederation of British Industry.It's a special worry that too few of the very best young people schooled in this country are now committing themselves to academic or research careers. We're fortunate in the UK to have high research productivity and several universities in the premier league. But this good fortune would be threatened if staff quality were not sustained.American universities maintain an ascendancy by draining talent from poorer countries. We in the UK are also making more academic appointments from abroad. That's welcome in itself—indeed, we should strive for a brain gain to match that of the USA. But it's precarious to be too dependent on potentially transient staff. (The situation is, incidentally, worse in economics than in almost any science subject.)Academic pay will never make us rich, but to stem the internal brain drain into other career paths it should surely keep pace with the public service. And we should resist the erosion of the distinctive features of academic life that compensate us for modest pay: relative autonomy, and the prospect, without undue hassle, of competing for basic funding for the research one chooses to do. And that choice is anything but frivolous—for most academic scientists, it's a judgement on which they stake much of their working life, and their reputation. Access to ‘responsive mode’ funding is as important as adequate salaries for maintaining the attractiveness of academia—and therefore the quality of our universities.In that connection, we should be uneasy at the mooted introduction of ‘economic benefit’ as a criterion in the assessment of research grant applications. There is indeed a case for favouring some areas of research on broad strategic grounds—genomics or nanophysics rather than string theory, for example. But that's different from trying to assess economic payoff at the level of a single grant application.Even the wizards of venture capital are highly fallible when they try to pick discoveries with commercial potential. To expect the average grants committee to make any worthwhile judgement—and, moreover, to do this at the ‘proposal’ stage, before the work has even been done—seems worse than unrealistic.None of the leading universities—in the UK or in the USA—are primarily ‘applied’ institutions: they excel at ‘curiosity-driven’ research. In the USA, Harvard and Stanford are regarded as major national assets because of their attraction for international talent, the collective expertise of their faculty, and the consequent quality of the graduates they feed into all walks of life. But each is embedded in a ‘cluster’ of research laboratories, small companies, non-governmental organizations, and so forth—to symbiotic benefit.The same is true here in the UK. Indeed, a recent report showed that the scale and success of such clusters was amazingly steeply correlated with the research strength of the embedded university.In the clusters that great universities attract around them, talent attracts talent (and big companies too). Success breeds success—and, just as importantly, failure is accepted as a step towards later success: a dynamic and interactive community develops that offers, in the words of a Financial Times article, a ‘low risk place to do high risk things’. The most effective knowledge transfer is via the movement of people.These phenomena featured in Lord Sainsbury's recent report on innovation, entitled The race to the top. His theme was that the UK can never compete on costs but only by leading the race towards greater sophistication—higher ‘value added’. This country's future is bleak unless we can compete at the top end of the value chain.Competition now comes not just from the USA and Europe, but from the burgeoning Far East, where the world's scientific talent and intellectual capital will surely become increasingly concentrated.The current strength of UK universities gives us a head start that we must sustain, despite growing competition. If they remain competitive, we can make this country a ‘partner of choice’ for global science and innovation—a magnet for mobile talent and inward investment. (Although the analogy is imperfect, there are similarities to the way in which the injection of sufficient resources allowed London to surge ahead as a global financial centre.)We don't know what the twenty-first-century counterparts of the electron, quantum theory, the double helix and the computer will be—nor where the great innovators of the future will get their formative training and inspiration. But it's not wishful thinking that the twenty-first century will be influenced by the creative ideas that germinate in these small islands.There is much debate on how well the UK is doing in the innovation stakes. The crude figures show that R&D is concentrated in a few areas such as pharmaceuticals and aerospace—and in the larger companies. But there is obviously a lot of innovative thinking in finance and other service sectors, which is not captured in the existing R&D statistics. I'd like to advertise the Royal Society's project on innovation in the services sector, which is just getting underway and which aims to seek other ways of assessing how well we're doing at turning science into impact.Many short-sighted decisions were made, and many opportunities lost, in the 1970s and 1980s—the collapse of our electronics industry was one consequence. The present government has gratifyingly learnt a key lesson: investment needs to be sustained. If we can be one of the best countries in the world in which to do science, benign positive feedbacks come into play; the law of increasing returns applies.Universities are a source of independent expertise—of people who can recognize a new idea from anywhere in the world and run with it. This may sometimes lead to commercial profit. But there's an ever-growing need for them to engage with public policy issues. The benefits of science are broader than ‘wealth creation’: they encompass our entire quality of life. Scientists must strengthen their engagement with the global challenges that will confront us all in the coming decades. Here again we in the UK have opportunities to be seized.Long-term global issuesEnergyHigh on the agenda should be the challenge of clean energy and the replacement of fossil fuels.The Energy Technology Institute has now been established; the Prime Minister recently announced backing for the first commercial-scale project for carbon capture and storage. These are welcome developments. But they are nowhere near the level that the challenge demands.Nothing could do more to attract the brightest and best into science than a strongly proclaimed commitment, from all technologically developed nations, to provide clean and sustainable energy for the developing and the developed world—to ensure security, diversity and efficiency of supply. Why shouldn't the UK take a lead?Energy R&D in this country has barely crept back up to the level attained in 1989 (before it plummeted after the privatizations). Some of the most exciting technologies are too far from the market to attract private funding. One of these, nuclear fusion, is funded at a global level of around 2 billion US dollars per year—a prudent investment for the world, even given the uncertainty and the several decades before a commercial pay-off. Indeed, there is a case for boosting the expenditure to bring pay-back closer. But if we take the expenditure on fusion as a ‘calibration’, there should be much-expanded R&D into a whole raft of techniques for storing energy and generating it by ‘clean’ or low-carbon methods.This is one of several themes on which the Society can campaign jointly with the Royal Academy of Engineering, and with its new President, Lord Browne. It is excellent that they have moved to 3–4 Carlton House Terrace, almost next door. (I have to say ‘almost’ because the Turf Club, at number 5, is interposed between us!)Climate and biosphereThe fourth report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) was published this year. The Society held an excellent discussion meeting in March on the scientific issues. Any open-minded enquirer who really wanted to understand the current consensus, and what the uncertainties are, could not have done better than to attend the lively debates at this meeting.The compelling strength of the IPCC's conclusions has turned around the perception of climate change. Most major financial institutions and businesses now realize that the issue is important for them. And governments are mindful that changes in climatic patterns—especially in the developing world—could aggravate possible conflicts by impacting on water resources, crop growth, and so forth.There is far more science to be done: the predicted global temperature rises are of course just an ‘index’ of large-scale changes in climatic patterns, and we need more detailed modelling (and more computer power) to assess the regional impacts on rainfall and extreme weather. But the debate now encompasses wider—and even more intractable—issues: the economics, the technological projections, and the politics. We must hope for substantive progress at Bali [where the next meeting of the states party to the UN framework convention on climate change (UNFCCC) was held] next week. Our own government's recently published Climate Change Bill addresses the challenge of cutting UK emissions by at least 60% by 2050.General ecological concerns are rising on the public agenda; most people are aware of how human actions threaten to ravage the entire biosphere. There have been five great extinctions in the geological past. We are now causing a sixth. We are destroying the book of life before we've read it.Biodiversity is a crucial component of human wellbeing and economic growth: we're clearly harmed if fish stocks dwindle to extinction; there are plants in the rain forest whose gene pool might be useful to us. But these ‘instrumental’—and anthropocentric—arguments aren't the only compelling ones. For many of us, preserving the richness of our biosphere has value in its own right, over and above what it means to us humans.Maintaining the health of our ecosystem is also a vital element in maintaining the health of our climate. Jointly with the UK Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA), the UK Joint Nature Conservation Committee (JNCC) and others (the UK Department for International Development; the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew; the Met Office Hadley Centre, UK; and the UK Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)), the Royal Society is therefore running a workshop at Bali next week to highlight the need for international policy-makers to tackle biodiversity and climate change as parts of an interconnected whole.What actually happens in the rest of the century will depend on developments even more imponderable than the climate science: new technology, future lifestyle, and the demands made on energy and raw materials—and of course on world population. Barring catastrophe, this will reach around 9 billion by 2050, but thereafter it could level off—and even start to decline—if the social trends that have led to reduced fertility in the more developed countries were to extend worldwide.Potential catastrophic risksQuite apart from the threats to the biosphere, we shall face, in our ever more interconnected world, risks of an unfamiliar kind: pandemics, ‘bioerror’, ‘bioterror’, and cyber risks stemming from the vulnerability of vast networks. Such catastrophes may be unlikely, but their consequences could be so widespread that even a low probability is deeply disquieting.We are familiar with the hazards of twentieth-century life, whether human-induced or natural. But what we should worry most about in the twenty-first century may be events that have never happened yet but where even one occurrence could stress our intermeshed civilization to breaking point.How can we assess these risks and—even more crucially—minimize their likelihood and mitigate their impact? This is surely a challenge that scientists should try to meet. They should collaborate worldwide to ensure that the best expertise is deployed; they can work nationally to advise governments. The difficulty of mustering support for effective mitigation of climate change stems from the remote-seeming and diffuse nature of the threat. It is even more difficult to divert resources from short-term needs and commit them to preparing for, or trying to avert, a disaster that may never happen at all. But careful analysis may suggest that substantial expenditure would be prudent as an ‘insurance policy’ even for an unlikely event.The Royal Society, and its sister academies, should surely do all they can to enhance understanding of these risks and press for appropriate action. Avian flu is a current example where this is being done, even if not with the urgency that this intractable international problem demands.Some scientific frontiersI have so far discussed issues of policy and politics, rather than science and technology themselves. But let me now briefly mention two ‘frontier’ scientific fields.SpaceFor astronomers in this country, 2007 offered an event worthy of acclaim: the 50th anniversary of the giant radio telescope at Jodrell Bank. It's now called the Lovell Telescope, and Sir Bernard was there to celebrate the instrument that he had the vision and persistence to build. It is an iconic structure—as much a part of our national heritage as Stonehenge—but at the same time it is still doing amazing science, of a kind that couldn't even have been conceived of when it was built.The Lovell Telescope has made many discoveries about pulsars—extraordinary objects discovered 40 years ago by Tony Hewish and Jocelyn Bell Burnell. These are neutron stars, spinning at up to 700 revolutions per second. Michael Kramer and his colleagues are now using the telescope for even more remarkable observations. A pair of pulsars have been found, orbiting around each other with a two-hour period. In this tightly bound system, relativistic effects, minuscule in the orbit of Mercury, are far more substantial. By timing the pulses from these little stars with microsecond precision, and thereby inferring how the orbits are changing, Einstein's general relativity can been tested more exactly than ever before.Actually, there was a double golden anniversary this year. It was on 5 October 1957 that Sputnik 1 was launched into orbit. The Jodrell Bank telescope was finished just soon enough to be able to track it.After Sputnik, the space race—fuelled largely, of course, by superpower rivalry—proceeded apace. Only 12 years later, Neil Armstrong took his ‘one small step’ on the Moon. But the Apollo project was an end in itself—there was no imperative to maintain the momentum, and it's been 35 years since the last men walked on the Moon. To young people today, it's ancient history—they know that the Americans went to the Moon, just as they know that the Egyptians built the Pyramids; but the motives seem almost as arcane in the one case as the other. Manned spaceflight—via the Shuttle and the Space Station, has never recovered the same glamour. However, there have been immense developments in the unmanned programmes of many spacefaring nations. We depend on space technology for communications, weather forecasting, mapping, position-finding and so forth—quite apart from the science it has given us.The largest space programmes are those of the USA and Russia—legacies of superpower rivalry. But there are great opportunities for Europe, and we in the UK could do more. Everyone has heard of NASA, many have heard of the European Space Agency, but few have heard of BNSC (the British National Space Centre). The UK has a cost-effective programme, but it needs higher-profile coordination. The Royal Society has therefore urged a higher-profile UK space agency so that we can exploit European opportunities better and can promote and develop the UK's success in space science and in the commercial arena.Stem cells and synthetic biologyAnd now for some quite different science, where I can claim no special expertise at all: stem cells and synthetic biology. We congratulate Sir Martin Evans on his Nobel Prize (shared with our Foreign Member Oliver Smithies) for pioneering work on stem cells. These have exciting potential for human health but raise novel and perplexing ethical issues. Traditional categories are being transcended: we can't clearly say whether an assemblage of cells is an embryo—still less whether it is human. Stem cell research is still in its early stages, but could offer potential benefit for diseases such as motor neuron disease, Parkinson's and Alzheimer's.In December 2006, the government announced an intention to ban some strands of research in this field. But the Royal Society, through discussion and consultations, has helped to change ministers' minds, as reflected in new proposals announced in October. We are pleased that the government responded to the advocacy of scientists. The new recommendations are incorporated in the wide-ranging Human Fertilisation and Embryology Bill. The Society's concern is that Parliament should approve the clauses relating to cytoplasmic hybrid embryos. During the passage of the Bill through both houses, we shall work with other organizations to promote discussion among parliamentarians and respond to their scientific queries.Stem cell legislation is a topical instance of the Society's important role in informing public discussion and debate. This role is wide-ranging. We remain engaged, for instance, with nanotechnology: we have followed up our widely acclaimed earlier report by initiating a dialogue with businesses concerned about the potential risks.Another potentially contentious growth area will be synthetic biology. This is the kind of new and exciting field that needs long-term support and investment. The scientific running will be made by those in a research environment where they can plan for the long term. Craig Venter may not be a model to emulate in all respects, but in vision and ambition he is.Synthetic biology, like nanotechnology, is somewhat ‘fuzzy’ in terms of its actual scope and definition. However, it also raises concerns about how the benefits are to be maximized and the potential downsides avoided. The Royal Society recently issued a call for views on the social, scientific and ethical issues that need to be addressed. We were gratified by the responses from policymakers, funders, non-governmental organizations and individual scientists and ethicists. Now we will move forward with a Working Group, and a ‘fast track’ Disc","citation":null,"page":"chunk_4_1"}

Ecological Society of America (ESA) is devoted to ensuring “the appropriate use of ecological science in environmental decision making by enhancing communication between the ecological community and policy makers”. I argue that ecological science is appropriately and importantly used when it instills ecological principles into macroeconomic policy making. Economic growth is an increase in the production and consumption of goods and services. It requires increasing population or per capita consumption and is generally indicated by increasing real gross domestic product (GDP). It is a primary, perennial, bipartisan goal of the American public and polity. Most ecologists suspect economic growth occurs at the expense of ecological integrity and environmental protection. However, we tend to leave economics to the economists, who prescribe economic growth as the solution to environmental problems. Our reticence is inappropriate, because we are the “economists of nature”. For example, ecologists are steeped in niche theory, including the principle of competitive exclusion. We know that one species does not proliferate except at the expense of others. Due to the tremendous breadth of the human niche, the human economy grows at the competitive exclusion of nonhuman species in the aggregate. Thus, the causes of species endangerment are a “Who's Who” of the American economy. Yet economists tell us we need economic growth for the sake of biodiversity conservation. Ecologists are also conversant with trophic theory. We know that increasing the biomass of consumers depends on increasing production in the plant kingdom. We also know that, given the laws of thermodynamics, there is a limit to the efficiency of converting producer biomass to consumer biomass and, ultimately, a limit to biomass production in the aggregate. We would do well to instill trophic theory into economic policy, which instead has been based on an ecologically ignorant theory that increasing productive efficiency will abrogate any limits to economic growth. To say there is no limit to economic growth on Earth is equivalent to saying that one may have a steady state economy on a perpetually diminishing land mass, but 63% of Americans believe there is no limit! Ecologists should not lose hope, because a new movement is engaging ecologists in economic policy. At the 1998 conference of The Wildlife Society, a symposium on ecological economics led to the formation of the Working Group for the Steady State Economy, which advocates adoption by the Society of a position on economic growth. A study was commissioned by The Wildlife Society, and the resulting Technical Review 03-1 identified a “fundamental conflict between economic growth and wildlife conservation”. At the 2004 conference, the Society's Council will vote on adopting a position on economic growth. It will help that the US Society for Ecological Economics adopted a position in 2003 that identifies a “fundamental conflict between economic growth and ecosystem health” (http://www.ussee.org/about). If a relatively conservative organization such as The Wildlife Society takes a position, it will be a snowball on a hilltop, for it will empower and embolden other societies to do likewise. The next most logical candidates for adopting a position are the Society for Conservation Biology (SCB), the American Fisheries Society (AFS), and ESA. Some steps have already been taken, especially in SCB and AFS. How would adopting these positions help? Political scientists describe “iron triangles” that dominate policy arenas. An iron triangle consists of a special interest group, a political faction, and a professional society (usually manifest in a government agency). The economic growth iron triangle is formidable. The “special interest group” is essentially the entire corporate community, which benefits from a theory of perpetual growth and resulting policies. Given our campaign finance system, the entire political community is wedded to corporate interests. (Have you heard a politician mention the perils of economic growth?) The professional side of the iron triangle is neoclassical economics, whose practitioners run the Council of Economic Advisors, Federal Reserve System, and Department of Commerce. The economic iron triangle has had carte blanche to boldly claim, “There is no conflict between economic growth and environmental protection!” If a critical mass of ecological societies adopts a position on economic growth, it will get media attention. Economic growth will be open to public scrutiny, as it briefly was in the 1970s without the support of professional societies. I conclude by exhorting ESA members to engage in this effort. Together, the groups mentioned above would form a powerful core around which dozens of other professional societies would gather. The ESA, after careful deliberations, should adopt a position on economic growth. An ESA position on economic growth would help to ensure “the appropriate use of ecological science in environmental decision making by enhancing communication between the ecological community and policy makers”, and in a very important way.

E.O. Wilson has identified the planet's 18 \"hotspots\" in terms of threatened biodiversity. In the United States only Southern California was identified as a hotspot. Southern California's coastal wetlands have been proposed for designation as \"Wetlands of International Significance\" under the Ramsar Convention. Southern California has lost 90% of its historical wetlands due to development. It has experienced an ongoing rate of growth unmatched by any other region of the world. With only 8.6% of the state's land mass, Southern California has almost 50% of the state's population. Coastal Southern California is a region like no other in terms of the growth and environmental transformation it has experienced. It also stands alone in terms of its geologic, hydrologic, climatic, and ecological characteristics. Wetlands research that has been based primarily on coastal systems of the Atlantic and Gulf region, has resulted in scientific findings, public policies, and educational programs that show little understanding of coastal Southern California's distinctive, highly dynamic wetland conditions. Against this backdrop of loss and lack of understanding, the Southern California Wetlands Recovery Project (WRP) was formed in 1998 to develop a coordinated and comprehensive strategy for preserving and restoring the region's waters. The WRP is a partnership of sixteen public agencies working cooperatively to acquire, restore, and enhance coastal wetlands and watersheds in the five coastal counties from Santa Barbara to San Diego. Using a non-regulatory approach and an ecosystem perspective, the WRP identifies wetland acquisition and restoration priorities, prepares plans for these priority sites, pools funds to undertake these projects, implements priority plans, and oversees post-project maintenance and monitoring. To date, the WRP and its agency partners have completed or underway projects that brought over 2,275 acres into public ownership, that restored or enhanced over 600 acres, and that financed studies to restore many more acres of wetlands.","citation":"Kathie Matsuyama (2005)","page":"chunk_4_1"}

Making Parks Work: Strategies for Preserving Tropical Nature is the result of the 1999 White Oak Plantation meeting in Florida, organized by the Center for Tropical Conservation at Duke University and the Wildlife Conservation Society. Scientists, practitioners, and conservation agencies examined success stories of biodiversity conservation in the tropics in an effort to find ways to make tropical protected areas effective for conservation. The book is intended to be a guide for practitioners in the field, government administrators, conservation organizations, and funding agencies interested in supporting effective and sustainable tropical parks. The volume provides a general overview of the status of parks around the world, discusses a range of problems that parks face, and suggests strategies to improve biodiversity conservation within parks. The book is arranged in four parts: an introduction, which sets the tone; a series of case studies; a discussion of crosscutting themes at park, national, and international levels; and a presentation of synthetic conclusions. In the introduction, the editors assert the necessity to manage parks “as a haven for a nature where people, except for visitors, staff, and concessionaires, are excluded” (p. 6). From there, they turn to a critique of the integrated conservation and development project (ICDP) model, which has become the primary challenge to the traditional “haven” approach to parks. The editors then contest the assumptions underpinning integrated conservation and development projects (ICDPs) and contend that “[p]arks are simply not the proper arena for resolving social inequities” (p. 25). In the final chapter of part 1, they respond to local opposition to park formation by taking a historical perspective to argue that strong public support usually develops after a park has been created. The case studies in part 2 are drawn from tropical regions around the globe. The section on Africa ranges from nearly hopeless West Africa to remarkably successful Madagascar. Authors of the case studies emphasize the threats of warfare, civil disorder, and development, and recognize the importance of international conservation organizations and committed individuals. Chapters on Latin America highlight the challenges of establishing a network of protected areas in Brazilian Amazonia, the immediate need for conservation policy and legislation, and the conflicts between local resource users and park enforcement, where alternative economic opportunities are limited. Costa Rica's national park system stands out as an economic and social success, but it is seen as an ecological stopgap measure. Case studies from Asia explore Nagarahole National Park in India; the Leuser Ecosystem in Sumatra; and protected areas in Indonesia, Thailand, and Bhutan. Part 3 includes a diverse series of chapters that cover important themes aimed specifically at addressing conservation concerns and management strategies at the level of individual parks and at national and international levels. One chapter provides recommendations on how to mitigate human and wildlife conflicts. Another focuses on the challenges of enforcing park regulations, such as the lack of institutional power, inadequate compensation for loss of land or resources, ineffective local guards, and the marginalized status of local residents. Other chapters in this part discuss the impacts of resource extraction by human residents in parks and suggest ways to improve and promote ecotourism activities both as an economic resource and as an opportunity to educate locals and tourists. The involvement of the private sector, anarchy in parks, international financing, internationalization of nature conservation, and the importance of political will to establish and manage parks are all explored in the section on national- and international-level themes. The section on general tools includes three disparate chapters on the importance of monitoring, the need for guiding principles that are “general, yet nontrivial” (p. 411), and a discussion of the “frontier model” of development. The book concludes by discussing the appropriate kinds of protected areas for a variety of social situations and reiterating the major themes of the book. According to the authors, biodiversity protection looks promising in the near future if nations follow a modernist development model. As a group of graduate students, postdoctoral students, and faculty members, we brought to this review a diversity of experiences and attitudes toward protected areas in the tropics. Our areas of expertise include conservation biology, sociology, anthropology, ecology, and political ecology. Our group includes proponents and critics of traditional protected areas. Consequently, the book sparked interesting discussions and provided a useful framework for an interdisciplinary discussion about parks and protected areas around the world. We found that the regional chapters show geographic breadth, are informative, and demonstrate the need for short-term conservation action. Many of the lessons from these examples are useful (e.g., communicating with local communities from the outset, establishing economic ties through tourism projects, and training nationals who then become invested in the park). The authors of the case studies draw on deep and intimate knowledge of the study areas and highlight particularities of each park and country. This allows the reader to gain a sense of the array of issues involved in park management, including enforcement, public support, political alliances, ecotourism, and poaching. Making Parks Work covers several specific topics that are useful as well, such as conflicts between establishing new parks versus existing well-managed parks, the role of the private sector in establishing parks and protecting biodiversity, and the possibility that periods of instability could lead to new structures that could help conserve biodiversity. We appreciated the inclusion of many different kinds of parks (e.g., private parks, biosphere reserves, and national protected areas). Given the book's intended audience, however, we expected more attention to concrete suggestions for people trying to make parks work in the field. Most of the case studies do not contain enough depth to be directly applicable to management strategies, and the sparse linkages among chapters make it difficult to compose meaningful generalizations. From a biological point of view, there is not enough information to support the broad statements made by many of the contributors. Key definitions of terms such as parks, ICDPs, and success shift among chapters, making it difficult to compare across case studies. Most importantly, we believe that the book needed more attention to big-picture conservation—the purpose of parks and how they fit into conservation on a landscape or global scale, given the unavoidable fact that parks cannot protect adequately all biodiversity. Addressing these issues with a more concrete and uniform approach would have made the case studies more useful to field practitioners. The chapter authors stress the need for creating parks to conserve biodiversity while recognizing the role of social, political, and ecological factors beyond park boundaries. But these authors seem to presume an audience already sympathetic to a traditional approach of strictly protected parks. Whereas such an assumption might have been tenable two or three decades ago, this book emerges in a very different context in which many of its premises have been subject to extensive critique. The book does not deal substantively with these competing perspectives. This issue is true of both the academic critiques of wilderness and protected areas as well as their application in the ICDP approach. For example, most chapters simply write off ICDPs as a failure, but the book contains no detailed evaluation of the actual effects of ICDPs on biodiversity on which to base this claim. Likewise, the dismissal of the critique that parks are culturally imperialistic overlooks a serious concern that reoccurs throughout the book in the guise of unruly locals, corrupt authorities, and insecure financial resources. Without recognizing the inequities rooted in the violent and exploitative experiences of colonialism, as well as the inequities produced by free-trade policies and liberalized international investment, it is difficult to imagine a productive dialogue about the challenges facing international conservation. Although the contributors may not agree with the critics of traditional park models, they need to take those criticisms seriously to participate effectively in current debates on protected areas management. Perhaps part of the problem is that many of the debates at the park-development interface have been situated in the social sciences, a discipline not well represented among the book's contributors. The notable dearth of social scientist contributors, especially among the editors, engenders problems when the book applies social-science-based concepts, such as development, culture, enforcement, and urbanization, in ways that suggest a lack of familiarity with current scholarship in these areas. For example, the view that “the world is a free and open marketplace of cultural values” (p. 9) obscures the substantial inequalities of power and resources involved in these cultural exchanges. Another notable example is the recurring use of a “frontier-crisis-stable land use” model of development (see especially chapter 30). According to this model, nations inevitably degrade natural resources until a “crisis stage.” Developed nations historically responded to this crisis by urbanizing and intensifying land use, which resulted in conservation gains. The authors suggest that developing nations can avert this “law-like progression” (p. 426) by promoting urbanization and intensive land use. Unfortunately, these policy proposals make troubling assumptions about the causal mechanisms that allowed developed nations to establish more efficient land uses. The development trajectory taken by developed nations was fostered by colonial relationships that allowed a base of wealth to be accumulated, subsequently allowing these nations to rely less on domestic natural resources and more on resources from the developing world. The developing world will not have similar opportunities, making policies founded on the model tenuous at best. Furthermore, the suggested policies contradict the social and environmental externalities of rapid urbanization and intensive agriculture that the authors suggest will hinder conservation success and stable land use. Accepting these policies as a desirable means to development supports a vision of development that may counter the goals of conservation. Making Parks Work would have been improved by better integration of examples, critique, and solutions. Case studies and discussion of themes provide a helpful foundation but would have been more effective if there had been stronger linkages across parts of the book. For instance, the “Themes” part of the book would have been richer had it drawn explicitly on the detailed case studies described in the book's second part. Even the concluding chapter by the editors makes no reference to the 13 case studies and makes minimal reference to other sections. In addition, the book would have been strengthened by a more direct treatment of conflicting points of view. A noteworthy exception is one of the concluding chapters by Brandon, which provides a rich example of how acknowledging and addressing opposing views can both enhance effectiveness of the analysis and provide a jumping-off point for important future work. The overall contribution of Brandon's chapter illustrates that despite the book's deficiencies, Making Parks Work clearly points to the need for more direct cooperation and collaboration between natural and social scientists in developing effective approaches to biodiversity conservation in protected areas. * The CenTREAD Working Group (part of the Center for Tropical Research in Ecology, Agriculture, and Development at the University of California Santa Cruz; http://centread.ucsc.edu) is a diverse group of scholars from the natural sciences, the social sciences, and interdisciplinary studies.

years ago, the Earth Summit held in Rio de Janeiro was thought by many to mark the emergence of a strong international response to global environmental threats. Few would have guessed that the summit would now be viewed as the high water mark of international environmental action. There is a frightening disconnect between the growing scientific evidence of global environmental problems such as climate change, biodiversity loss, and nitrogen loading, and the rapidly diminishing political attention given to the environment. Within the industrialized world, the environmental problems of the 1960s and 1970s that spawned the environmental movement were the “in your face” issues of air and water pollution. They literally could not be ignored and, as a consequence, considerable progress has been made in addressing them. It is all too easy to ignore the environmental problems of today, even though they are far more threatening to the planet's life support systems. Their impacts are distant in time, while actions to address them often incur immediate costs. It is easy for us to bemoan the fact that decision makers are not acting in response to the growing scientific understanding of these problems. But in fact, decision makers didn’t respond to good science in the 1960s and 1970s either – they responded to the public demand for action (which in turn was supported by science). Simply put, no matter how sound the science, action will not be taken to address global environmental threats until the public demands it and until the need is recognized by the wide range of stakeholders who will benefit and pay the costs. That is far from the case today. Ecological research findings related to these global environmental challenges reach only a small fraction of the broad array of decision makers and the public who must ultimately press for changes. Instead, all too often, we are preaching to the converted in efforts to bring science to bear on public policy. It is not enough to have reports read by Ministries of Environment when the real power over the environment lies with the Ministries of Finance and in corporate boardrooms. One international scientific effort that seeks to break through to new audiences is the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MA), launched by the Secretary General of the United Nations in 2001 and involving nearly 1000 social and natural scientists. One year from now, the MA will release a set of four technical assessment reports focused on the consequences of ecosystem change for human well-being and a series of shorter summary and synthesis reports. The MA has been designed to be relevant not just to the environment sector, but also to other public sectors, business, and industry. The basic framework that the MA utilizes is based on the concept that ecosystems provide services that are of benefit to humanity. The assessment is evaluating what these services are, how they are valued by society, and how the services are being enhanced or degraded by human actions. All of this is put in the context of examining services in a holistic manner so that tradeoffs in resource use can be fully evaluated. Then, importantly, it provides contrasting scenarios of plausible futures for ecosystem services as well as an analysis of what kinds of options we have, or could devise, to alter future trajectories to favorable outcomes. The MA has engaged a broad spectrum of users from the outset. The MA Board is a reflection of the multiple audiences, including representatives of governments, international conventions, companies, the media, NGOs, and indigenous groups. A considerable effort is also being made to ensure that its products are widely disseminated. One important outreach mechanism stems directly from the basic structure of the MA. Most decision makers concerned with the use of natural resources do not operate at the global level. As a result, in addition to its global assessment, the MA is undertaking a set of subglobal assessments within regions, nations, watersheds, and local communities. MA subglobal assessments are now underway around the world, including in southern Africa, Sweden, India, Peru, Chile and Western China, to name a few. Earth's natural resources are being compromised by human activities. We are slowly assembling the scientific information that will enable us to show stakeholders what this means for them, today and in the future. It is incumbent upon the scientific community to ensure that its findings are available to individuals who can act upon them. Increasingly, the decision makers whose actions matter are those outside of the “traditional” audience for ecological information. That audience won’t come knocking on our doors. New mechanisms are needed to link science to this broader audience, and the MA may provide a useful model.

3rd International Wild Boar Symposium was organised by the Research Unit of the Swedish Association for Hunting and Wildlife Management and was held in Uppsala, Sweden, in September 2000. The Symposium gathered almost 50 wildlife researchers and managers from Australia, France, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Israel, Japan, the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Russia, Slovenia, South Africa, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom. The timing and location of the Symposium in Sweden was fitting, due to the rapid increase of the Swedish wild boar population. The debate among farmers, sportsmen and governmental authorities clearly indicated the necessity to synthesise knowledge and experience from around the world. The presentations given at the 3rd International Wild Boar Symposium covered a wide range of topics, such as effects of wild boar on farmed crops and livestock, social organisation, population structure, effects of hunting on wild boar behaviour, supplemental feeding and effects of predators. Other important aspects of wild boar behaviour were dynamics of home range establishment, activity patterns during foraging, as well as home range use and the role of the wild boar in increasing biodiversity. Both managers and scientists agreed on the necessity of increased co-operation to meet the needs of managers, to improve the scientific knowledge about wild boars, and to develop better monitoring methods. It was concluded that regular international Symposia and workshops would contribute to reaching these goals. To stimulate increased scientific soundness and transparency of the presented results, we chose WILDLIFE BIOLOGY as an international forum to publish the proceedings, and this encouraged the participants to produce high quality papers for the Symposium. It also will increase the distribution of the proceedings. All papers that were submitted from the 3rd International Wild Boar Symposium for publication in WILDLIFE BIOLOGY were critically reviewed by at least two scientists, many of whom had not participated in the Symposium. The same criteria and standards were used as for other manuscripts submitted to WILDLIFE BIOLOGY. The referees' recommendations helped the authors improve their manuscripts and were of great help to the Editor-in-Chief of WILDLIFE BIOLOGY, Jon E. Swenson, and me when deciding which papers would be included in this supplementary issue of WILDLIFE BIOLOGY. We hope you find this Proceedings issue of WILDLIFE BIOLOGY to be as stimulating and thought provoking as we do. We also express our thanks to the Swedish Association for Hunting and Wildlife Management and the Swedish Environmental Protection Agency for financing the Symposium and publication of the proceedings.","citation":"Jonas Lemel (2003)","page":"chunk_4_1"}

This statement immediately raises questions for the critically aware citizen about the criteria on which this announcement is based. Equally, it raises questions about the outcome of this evaluation, were it viewed from a European or global perspective.It is undeniably true that for most Dutch citizens the material prosperity has increased considerably. This is a positive development, which has consequences for many aspects of society: Dutch citizens reap the benefits in many ways. There are however other aspects of life that are important in reaching a judgement on whether things are 'going well' for the Netherlands, Europe or the world. I will mention four of these aspects:Developments as seen in relation to ecological balance and environmentThe relation between wealth and povertyThe position of human labourThe state of public order and safetyIf we include the above aspects in the assessment, the picture becomes less favourable. Ecological balances are still being disturbed and the environment is deteriorating. The use of finite resources of fossil fuel is still growing, while the consequences of this for the quality of the environment are becoming increasingly clear. Global warming is now accepted by the vast majority as a certainty and the effects are becoming evident. At the same time we see a diminishing biodiversity and disturbance of the hydrological cycle. A basic need such as clean and safe drinking water has become a very difficult commodity to obtain in many parts of the world.Differences in material prosperity that have slowly arisen over the centuries have not diminished, but even increased lately. One of the consequences of this for the richer nations of the world is that there is a steady flow of migrants from poor to rich countries, all hoping for a better life.Apart from some conjunctural upswings, unemployment in the western world is extensive and permanent. The social consequences of this, especially in (very) large urban conurbations, are immense. At the same time a clear tendency towards the degradation of human labour is present.Finally it must be concluded that public safety has decreased. This is true for both objectively measurable and subjectively perceived safety. An important factor in this is the major increase in aggression and violence.In widening our perspective and not just focusing on material well-being, the picture becomes less favourable than many want us to believe. Set against positive developments such as economic growth and technical knowledge, are other, negative developments. In order to steer these developments in another direction, as far as this is possible, it is necessary to adjust policy in a great many areas. This is achievable, only, if we are aware of negative developments, and if we want to change. However, if the will to change is present and policies change, it often becomes evident after some time that the (political) choices bear too few fruits. The result is not infrequently that certain problems increase rather than diminish. Looking back over the recent past, it even seems as if in many challenges there is an inability to come up with an adequate and timely response.Several explanations can be given for this. If responsible politicians and other policymakers suffer ideological tunnel vision, or if they are not fully aware of the full extent and nature of the different problems, then they will be unable to fully solve them. Another important explanation is that issues are often seen in isolation, i.e. without recognition of the relationships with other developments. Modern society is very complex, and so are the problems it poses. It is therefore understandable that policy makers, amongst others, have a tendency to concern themselves with relatively easy to grasp part-problems and are increasingly less able to have an overview of the whole picture. This is however no excuse for not trying. Economy, technology, education, environment, criminality and safety are, after all, largely interconnected. Any policy that takes insufficient account of this is bound to lead to disappointment and frustration.In this book I discuss such problems in relation to culture. 'Culture' has to be taken in the widest sense of the word. It embraces everything that people have gained and accomplished in their society and given environment, all products of hand and mind, material and immaterial, structures and institutions. It concerns widely held value judgements, beliefs and direction. The concept of culture and its meaning are discussed further in chapter II.The central question I want to pose is whether, over the centuries, there have been sweeping changes in Western culture, which have led to the above developments and problems. It is important to investigate these changes and their consequences, in order to learn lessons for the future. The last three centuries have indeed seen such changes. Where for centuries there used to be a tendency for a certain balance between existing components, both material and immaterial, things have changed dramatically during the last two centuries. Factors influencing these changes are varied and follow on from developments that started after the end of the European Middle Ages. These developments resulted in a gradually broadening rift between Western and other world cultures. A rift that was inextricably linked to splits within Western culture itself. In this culture, one component became increasingly important and began to be more independent. Economic growth became, especially after the industrial revolution, the central component of culture and profit maximalisation became the watchword. Man and his labour were increasingly viewed from this perspective and this narrowing of vision became generally accepted.Within the economy a profound theoretical and ideological struggle existed for a long time, which was decided (for the time being) in the nineteen seventies in favour of the adherents to the neoclassical \"free market\" thinking. The political consequences have been enormous, firstly in the United States, but then also in the rest of the world. A radicalisation of the economy took place distinguishing itself through a hardening of competition that became worldwide (globalisation). In recent times the limitations to the international flow of capital, which existed since 1944's Breton Woods international treaty, disappeared. Especially after the fall of communism in Russia and Europe a strong power shift took place, from the state (government) to multinationals.This development would not have been possible without the impressive growth of another culture component, science and technology. Not only people from Western cultures were curious about the hidden forces of Creation. Other people, such as Asians, were curious too, and Westerners were often not the first to make a discovery. Other cultures did not have, however, what the atom physicist von Weizacker called, the \"childish\" need to make everything that can be made. Within Western culture a close relationship grew between science and technology, extending also to economy and economic thinking, giving rise to the birth of a powerful scientific, technological and economic doctrine. This, in turn, brought Western society the first modern health technology, aviation, the atom bomb, television, computer, biotechnology, biological warfare etc. The core question: what to do with these technologies, is in many cases answered by asking how great the profitability will be of eventual industrial production.This way, the culture components science/technology and economy have grown out of proportion, have made themselves absolute and are dominating other components. This process still continues today, although opposition is growing. The dominant powers have, according to the sociologist/theologian/politician Banning, become \"threatening powers\".The severance of the tendency to an equilibrium between culture components has had profound effects for Western culture as a whole. In order to maintain the highest possible level of productivity of goods and services, a high level of consumption is needed. This can only be achieved through artificially increasing human need to a level that greatly surpasses the primary necessities of life. Advertising brings us the, almost religious, instruction: \"Thou shalt desire!\" Advertising and public relations now play an important role in the dissemination of opinions and the needs associated with them, that people accept as the truth. The inflated wish for 'more' has of course had its impact on other fields, such as the development of criminality. The imbalance between culture components has implications also for the relationship between individual and community. Many researchers, from different disciplines reach the same conclusion: there is an emergence of an extreme type of individualism that supersedes the sense of community. Following on from this appears a greater susceptibility to emotions that are not supported by reason, but yet are experienced uniformly by a great many people.Some norms and values have remained unchanged through the centuries, while others have eroded and disappeared. New norms and values have arisen, however, and still continue to do so. A new value is for instance the attention for the universal rights and duties of citizens. Examples of this are found in the manner in which war criminals are pursued nowadays and in the tendency to judge fellow citizens by their 'usefulness'. The first example leads to a greater respect for our fellow human beings, the latter to a decline in respect and an increased legitimisation of discrimination and violence. The vastly increased use of advertising and public relations has influenced the meaning of the concept 'truth'.The emphasis on the usefulness of people has its consequences for our view and determination of human labour. Under the influence of our economic thinking 'labour' has narrowed down to 'paid labour'. Human labour mainly counts as a production factor, which can be supported by machines - in their broadest sense- but can also increasingly be replaced by machines. Human labour is therefore increasingly a derivative of the quest for economic growth, the safeguarding of financial interests and the exploitation of technological findings.The negative developments outlined above have such a degree of importance, next to the positive developments in Western culture, especially if they are left to continue unchecked, that they will undermine the quality of human existence. Hence a plea that is especially aimed at the interest of generations to come, for a broadly supported policy that intentionally guides us to new directions within Western culture - before it is too late. Thoenes even spoke of \"a desperate need for cultural renewal\". Such a reforming culture policy, which is aimed at all components of culture in their mutual interactions, has to be directed at a maximisation of balance within our culture. This will be a lengthy process, which calls for an awakening of consciousness, and therefore has to be based on conviction and will. It is encouraging that a strengthening countermovement of many individuals and non-government organisations, active in many fields, is emerging, providing a structure to be built on. Essential, however, is the question: where do we want to go? To this question I would like to contribute in the second part of this book.It is inescapable that government, in every form, plays a central role in this process of change, a role that can only be fulfilled if government can rely upon support from a broad cross-section of society.Central to a cultural policy is the emphasis on, and application of values. Values form after all - and it is essential to acknowledge this - the backbone of any culture. Which values do we then choose? In my plea I start from values that are in part at odds with presently predominating values, such as respect for nature, control of self, moderation and frugality, durability, mindfulness of the exceptionally great risks of modern times, trustworthiness and integrity; a stable balance between individual and community, solidarity and tranquillity. All these values are based on the old concept of human dignity. These values however, if they are to be durable, will also have to be based on a firm religious or secular foundation.Religion, with its views, values and norms, has a profound influence on culture. Conversely, culture influences religion. The dominant position of science and technology gave rise to an unlimited belief in its potentiality. Many Christian thinkers therefore tend to retreat in their own theology, whilst various scientists have made appeals for a profound dialogue with the different religions.The primacy of the economy and economic thinking creates something, which Huizinga calls: \"a habitus that is the opposite of Christianity.\" Indeed, the leading principle of economics \"Thou shalt desire\" turns the biblical vision of discouraging desire, on its head.I share van der Leeuw's opinion that a profound renewal of a culture is possible only if it includes all segments of this culture. As cultural components are interwoven, it is imperative to bear their mutual cohesion in mind. I will mention several policy areas of great importance.Policies on technology should not be based on an autonomous position of technology. According to van Melsen, a development that is aimed at harnessing nature should itself not be allowed to evade regulation. Technology should be ruled democratically and should be guided towards the service of humankind and world. Technology creates many possibilities, but we shall have to answer the question, if all possibilities must be applied, do we wanteverything technology can deliver? Technology will have to be viewed in relation to the quality of our environment, genetic modification and the influence of advertising or applied Information and Communication Technology on the thoughts and actions of people. We also need to answer the question: who bears the responsibility for important and risk-bearing decisions, such as those concerning genetics, nanotechnology and robotics? The danger of abuse or accidents in these fields is real. So is it possible to govern technology? The answer to this is \"yes\", especially because the most important developments arise at the interface between technology and economy, in which technology is made to be subservient to the quest for profit.Scientific research is difficult to guide, the dominant views in a culture are part-determining factors for research. The strong influence of technology and economy in the Western culture is obvious in choices and priorities concerning funding for scientific research and universities. Under a balanced scientific policy the arts, languages and social sciences are on a par with mainstream science, with the necessary consequence of an equality of financial support. This would also mean that, despite the existing far-reaching specialisation, it is important to try and aim research at the discovery of cohesion. It is therefore imperative that different disciplines will learn each other's language and start to communicate.Even more important is to end the grip of economy on the 'science industry'. A responsible science policy demands a democratic cultural policy that in turn benefits from a science policy as described above.Economic policy will have to be aimed at a control of economic activities, in order to protect and further the main interests of human being and society. Similarly, economic activities will have to fit within ecological prior conditions. The creation of demand for products and goods, aided by refined advertising techniques, should be prevented. Besides ecological considerations human dignity is at stake here too. There is a place only for objective, i.e. verifiable, product information. The economy needs to be aimed also at the evening out of differences in prosperity, the degradation of human labour and the eradication of unemployment.Education , i.e. all the activities aimed at preparing for, and being equipped for, life in society, is a cornerstone of every culture. An important question is what we may expect from people that are equipped for life in Europe in the 21st century. We should at least expect emancipation, the ability to deal with an abundance of largely fragmented information, the ability to gain insight in complex problems and to deal with information from the mass media in a critical way. Education should especially be aimed at whole-ness. The pursuit of holism and balance in culture can be effective only if it is mirrored in the pursuit of holism and balance in man. Education will therefore have to be aimed in equal measures at general knowledge, spiritual, economic, technical and social aspects.The primary living unit , i.e. the family can play an important role in the restoration of cultural balance. In this unit a form of cohabitation should exist that is aimed at durability, mutual support and care and emotional security. The family continually interacts with society. Family policy is an important part of cultural policy, because bringing up children is one of the most important functions of the family. Family policy therefore is two-pronged: the strengthening of the family from within and the underpinning of the place for this unit in society.The mass media too mirror the cultural imbalance, especially in this century in which new developments and problems will present themselves at a fast pace. In a democratic society a reliable source of information is invaluable. This poses a great responsibility for those people who control the mass media and who disseminate information. They must therefore meet high standards of professionalism and ethical awareness. Most citizens see reality through the spectacles of the journalist, commentator, photographer or cameraman. They are usually not able to see to what degree journalists, consciously or subconsciously, distort reality. Besides this there is a real danger that the contents of media offerings are influenced by the commercial powers that finance the media. Powers such as the state, the economy and technology need counter forces in the interest of cultural balance. This is certainly true for the media. This principle is one of the most important conditions for the preservation of democracy.A balanced cultural policy places high demands on government . Government has to be inspiring, visionary, strong and convincing. It cannot limit itself to fighting symptoms and postponing necessary measures until, during or after the crisis, they become feasible (government by crisis). Such conduct is possible only within the framework of a comprehensive cultural policy, in which different policy areas support each other. It is essential to restore the democratic form of government: the right of citizens to co-determine and influence policy in its fullest extent, without relinquishing power to 'industry' or 'the market'.Against ongoing trends in globalisation over the past decades, it is not realistic to restrict cultural policy to the national state.Now that Europe and the European Union are becoming increasingly significant, it has led to my dissertation resulting in an appeal for a European culture policy that has consideration for the economy and technology, but considers in equal measures other policy areas such as education and scientific research. Such policies would enable Europe to become visible to its citizens and this would prevent the European unification from creating a \"Europe without the Europeans\", as mentioned by Von der Gablentz.In the preceding contemplations and arguments the possibility emerges that the advocated changes will also influence the relationship with other cultures, as they did in the past. It is to be hoped that this will be a positive influence. This prospect strengthens the case for the removal of imbalances in Western culture.","citation":"J.A.C. van Burg (2001)","page":"chunk_4_1"}

J. (1999) Requiem for nature. Island Press/Shearwater Books, Washington, DC. xii + 234 pp, figs, index. Hardback: Price $24.95. ISBN 1 559 63587 8. ‘From my earliest days as a preschooler, my abiding obsession has been discovering and appreciating nature … My goal was to discover all the snakes, turtles, salamanders, birds, mammals, and what-have-you … The thrill of each new find contributed to a budding knowledge of natural history.’ These introductory sentences by John Terborgh, Professor of Environmental Science and Botany and co-director of the Center for Tropical Conservation at Duke University, could have been written by another famous naturalist, Ernst Thompson Seton. I am sure that Terborgh, like most of us, also read his books. However, Seton was lucky to live one century earlier when the landscape of his boyhood was not destroyed by bulldozers during his lifetime. All changes were much slower at the beginning of the last century. Now, all human-caused transformations of our planet are accelerating, especially in countries with fast population growth, unstable societies, weak institutions, and inadequately protected areas. Incidentally, those are essentially the same countries where most of the terrestrial biological diversity is, or was, concentrated: countries possessing what is left of tropical forests. Can money from agencies like USAID or the international banks help? Yes, but it would have to be done differently than in the last decades. A seemingly logical assertion that ‘the real threat to wildlife is poverty, not poaching’ has been repeated many times (e.g. Attfield, 1999). However, fashionable attempts to integrate economic development with conservation have failed to protect tropical forests. By stimulating the local economy, so called ‘integrated conservation and development project’ typically attracts newcomers to a park’s perimeter, thereby increasing the external pressure on the park’s resources. Development-oriented conservation projects, relying on large amounts of foreign money, often ignore the implications of the fact that much forest exploitation is conducted by recent immigrants who have no long-term commitment to the area they are exploiting. Using examples from tropical countries around the world, Terborgh shows that what is called ‘progress’ and ‘sustainable development’ by many, is in fact an unprecedented destruction of nature and a recipe for extinction of species. Based on more than 30 years’ experience as a primate ecologist in West Africa, Oates (1999) comes to the same conclusion. Two important issues, reduction of poverty and biological conservation, have been confused. Terborgh’s ‘nature’ is the web of interactions among species, the continuity of processes in human-undisturbed ecosystems. Terborgh has used many opportunities to study species interactions: from pristine forests of Manu National Park in Perú, through somewhat simplified forest on Barro Colorado Island in Panama, to bizarre remnants of animal communities in forest fragments on islets in Lago Guri in Venezuela. Chapter 7, where some relevant results of his field studies are summarized, reads like a detective story. To preserve biodiversity means to maintain the web of interactions that regulates and perpetuates the ecological system. Unfortunately, many of the world’s parks are not large enough to maintain populations of top predators; they are unable to sustain the full spectrum of ecological functions needed to preserve biodiversity. Still, any park, as long as it is really protected, is better than no park. But who will pay? The situation is somewhat easier with savanna parks with high densities of big mammals. Here, tourism can be a source of badly needed money. Tropical forests are much less attractive. A good starting point would be to establish national conservation trust funds, essentially endowments in support of parks. Trust funds (some already have been created in Bhutan and Mexico) offer an enormous advantage over short-term projects (see also Southgate, 1998). The key, however, is law enforcement. Adequate financing in itself does not guarantee successful parks if enforcement is not rigorously implemented. Exposing the gloomy status of tropical forest national parks across three continents (many are essentially just on paper, some are ‘empty’ without any larger edible animals, others are illegally logged or encroached), Terborgh concludes that enforcement is the sine qua non of biodiversity preservation. Local people should be involved as it really helps in the long run. A bottom-up approach as exemplified by community-based conservation can work under some fortunate circumstances (Western, 1997), however, biodiversity transcends national boundaries and belongs to no one. It belongs only to the planet Earth. The most radical, but very likely the only potentially successful option would be full internationalization of nature protection. If peacekeeping has been widely accepted as a function of the United Nations, why not nature keeping? Internationally sponsored guards would be independent of local pressures and thus better able to exercise authority. This seems to be the only solution. However, as Terborgh knows very well, this will not be easy to realize. Even much less ambitious international conservation projects in tropical countries have already been labeled as ‘ecocolonialism’ (Southerland, 1998). Fortunately, not everybody feels that way. For example, Mario Boza, former Director of National Parks and Vice Minister of Natural Resources, Energy, and Mines in the government of Costa Rica, already had this clear vision: ‘Many organizations use funds to maintain an international bureaucracy rather than supporting direct conservation in the field … International environment standards should be set by a United Nations environmental organization that is empowered to infringe on sovereignty of individual states in environmental matters’ (Boza, 1993). However, if the international nature keeping turns out to be unrealistic, than, I am afraid, the title of Terborgh’s book is accurate.","citation":"Marcel Rejmánek (2000)","page":"chunk_4_1"}

essay examines the issues of equity and efnciency in the use of global environmental resources, with the atmosphere as a case in point. It shows a somewhat unexpected connection between the two issues in the context of international greenhouse gas emissions trading markets. Contrary to common wisdom, achieving a more even distribution of property rights to environmental assets is more than a matter of equity Property rights also influence market efficiency. I show that a precondition for market efficiency is that more property rights in the global commons should be given to those regions that own fewer private goods. This connection leads to recommendations to implement the greenhouse gas emissions trading regimes authorized by the Kyoto Protocol to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (FCCC). In order to ensure an efficient trading market, developing countries should be allocated proportionately more emissions rights than industrial countries. In addition, there is a need to create an International Bank for Environmental Settlements (IBES) as a self-financing institution that can obtain market value from environmental resources while preserving them. Emissions trading, the global reinsurance of environmental risks, and securitization of the earth’s biodiversity resources are financial instruments that merge the interests of the private financial markets with international sustainable development policy These instruments and institutions should help to redefine economic progress in away that is compatible with a harmonious use of the world’s resources and with equity among rich and poor nations.","citation":"Graciela Chichilnisky (2000)","page":"chunk_4_1"}

Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1993. 271 pp. US$49,95 cloth ISBN: 0-19-823323-X . Part (75%) recycled paper. I have waited with a rare sense of anticipation for the publication of this second Yearbook from the Fridtjof Nansen Institute. My anticipation has not been misplaced. The previous edition's fairly equal division of essays and reference material has been continued here, giving the work considerable added value over the more usual collections of essays on the environment. In the first section, readers are offered articles by a distinguished and experienced group of authors. The areas covered are: the role of NGOs at the 1992 Rio Summit, forestry and biodiversity, international business and sustainable development, GATT, the World Bank, and the attempts to solve pollution problems in the North Sea through international cooperation. These topics have been chosen to further the Yearbook's objective of demonstrating: (1) how far the international community has come in solving environmental and development problems, (2) what the main obstacles are to effective international solutions, and (3) what needs to be done to overcome these hindrances (13). Like sustainability itself, the achievement of these objectives is a long-term project to which the authors make a useful contribution. Good as the essays are (and they are very informative), what makes the Yearbook really stand out is the reference section. The first part of the reference section systematically details 42 international agreements on the environment and development. Agreements on biodiversity, atmosphere, marine environment, hazardous substances and nuclear safety are included. The specifics on each agreement include: objectives, scope, time and place of adoption, entry into force, number of parties, any affiliated protocols, annexes and organizations, any secretariat, rules and standards, monitoring/implementation, decision-making, and publications. The participation of individual states in each agreement is summarized in a separate table. The second and third parts of the reference section give similar treatment to 18 major inter-governmental organizations and 24 NGOs. The details offered for each of these include: objectives, organization, secretariat, activities, decision-making bodies, finance, and publications. As before, national participation in each of these organizations is summarized in tabular form. The reference section offers unparalleled easy access to the world of treaties, coordinating bodies, and international pressure groups. For individuals who are (or think they may be) interested in a particular treaty or organization, this book (and its sister volumes) offers a splendid starting point. It will be of value to decision-makers in the public, private and voluntary sectors, as well as to educators, researchers and students. However, being available only in hardback, its price is likely to mean that it will be bought by institutions rather than individuals. For this reason, I would suggest strongly that librarians place a standing","citation":"Alistair J. A. McCulloch (1995)","page":"chunk_4_1"}
