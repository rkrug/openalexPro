Abstract Governmental interventions that set out to improve the world are assembled from diverse elements – discourses, institutions, forms of expertise and social groups whose deficiencies need to be corrected, among others. In this article I advance an analytic that focuses on practices of assemblage – the on-going labour of bringing disparate elements together and forging connections between them. I identify six practices that are generic to any assemblage, whatever its specific contours: 1) forging alignments, 2) rendering technical, 3) authorizing knowledge, 4) managing failures, 5) anti-politics, and 6) reassembling. I demonstrate the power of this analytic through an extended study of community forest management. This is an assemblage that brings together an array of agents (villagers, labourers, entrepreneurs, officials, activists, aid donors, scientists) and objectives (profit, pay, livelihoods, control, property, efficiency, sustainability, conservation). Its very unwieldiness helps to sharpen analysis of how such an assemblage is, in fact, assembled, and how it has been sustained for more than thirty years, absorbing hundreds of millions of dollars in programmes from the west coast of Canada to the eastern islands of Indonesia. I do not attempt to adjudicate the rights and wrongs of this assemblage. Rather, I deploy an analytic of assemblage to explore the practices that fill the gap between the will to govern and the refractory processes that make government so difficult.

For an outline of the concept of government as the ‘conduct of conduct’ and intervention in the relations between ‘men and things’ to secure the welfare of the population, see Foucault (1991 Foucault, M. 1991. “‘Governmentality’”. In The Foucault Effect: Studies in Governmentality, Edited by: Burchell, G., Gordon, C. and Miller, P. Chicago, IL: University of Chicago Press. [Google Scholar]). See also Dean (1999), Gordon (1991 Gordon, C. 1991. “‘Governmental rationality: an introduction’”. In The Foucault Effect: Studies in Governmentality, Edited by: Burchell, G., Gordon, C. and Miller, P. Chicago, IL: University of Chicago Press. [Google Scholar]) and Rose 1999). I explore ‘the will to improve’ in Li (2007). 3. Barry (2001 Barry, A. 2001. Political Machines: Governing a Technological Society, London: Athlone. [Google Scholar]: 10–11, 218, fn. 38) similarly stresses agency, process and emergence over the kind of completed order suggested by Foucault's term dispositif. See the extended ethnographic treatment of assemblage as emergence in Moore (2005 Moore, D. 2005. Suffering for Territory: Race, Place, and Power in Zimbabwe, Durham, NC: Duke University Press. [Crossref] , [Google Scholar]). 4. See Rose (1999 Rose, N. 1999. Powers of Freedom: Reframing Political Thought, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. [Crossref] , [Google Scholar]: 19) and Dean (1999 Dean, M. 1999. Governmentality: Power and Rule in Modern Society, London: Sage. [Google Scholar]: 31). In Li (2007 Li, T. M. 2007. The Will to Improve: Governmentality, Development, and the Practice of Politics, Durham, NC: Duke University Press. [Crossref] , [Google Scholar]) I argue for bringing studies of government into dialogue with histories and sociologies of rule without collapsing one into the other. My argument builds upon those of Clarke (2004 Clarke, J. 2004. Changing Welfare, Changing States: New Directions in Social Policy, London: Sage. [Google Scholar]) and O'Malley et al. (1997 O'Malley, P., Weir, L. and Shearing, C. 1997. ‘Governmentality, criticism, politics’. Economy and Society, 26: 501–17. [Taylor & Francis Online], [Web of Science ®] , [Google Scholar]) who critique the neglect of practice and instability in studies of government. 5. Rose (1999 Rose, N. 1999. Powers of Freedom: Reframing Political Thought, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. [Crossref] , [Google Scholar]: 48) calls this process ‘translation’, a term that suggests the uni-directional conversion of something that is fixed. I prefer ‘forging alignments’, which leaves open the question of how lines are adjusted to accommodate divergent agendas. See O'Malley (1996 O'Malley, P. 1996. ‘Indigenous governance’. Economy and Society, 25: 310–26. [Taylor & Francis Online], [Web of Science ®] , [Google Scholar]) and Li (1999 Li, T. M. 1999. ‘Compromising power: development, culture and rule in Indonesia’. Cultural Anthropology, 14: 1–28. [Crossref] , [Google Scholar]) for empirical studies of how programmes were altered by their ‘target groups’. 6. See Rose (1999 Rose, N. 1999. Powers of Freedom: Reframing Political Thought, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. [Crossref] , [Google Scholar]: 33) on the bounding and dissecting of a technical domain. 7. See Ferguson (1994 Ferguson, J. 1994. The Anti-Politics Machine: ‘Development’, Depoliticization, and Bureaucratic Power in Lesotho, Minneapolis, MN: University of Minnesota Press. [Google Scholar]: 270) and Mitchell (2002 Mitchell, T. 2002. Rule of Experts: Egypt, Technopolitics, Modernity, Berkeley, CA: University of California Press. [Crossref] , [Google Scholar]). 8. On the attempt to constitute active citizens while containing critique, see Cruikshank (1999 Cruikshank, B. 1999. The Will to Empower: Democratic Citizens and Other Subjects, Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press. [Crossref] , [Google Scholar]). 9. For a helpful discussion of changing concepts of agency in the earlier and later Foucault, see Dupont and Pearce (2001 Dupont, D. and Pearce, F. 2001. ‘Foucault contra Foucault: rereading the “governmentality” papers’. Theoretical Criminology, 5: 123–58. [Crossref], [Web of Science ®] , [Google Scholar]: 144). 10. Scott (1998 Scott, J. C. 1998. Seeing Like a State: How Certain Schemes to Improve the Human Condition Have Failed, New Haven, CT: Yale University Press. [Google Scholar]) outlines the combination of utopic dreams and concentrated powers under which high modern schemes emerged. I situate Scott's approach in relation to studies of governmentality in Li (2005 Li, T. M. 2005. ‘Beyond “the state” and failed schemes’. American Anthropologist, 107: 383–94. [Crossref], [Web of Science ®] , [Google Scholar]). Compare Cruikshank (1999 Cruikshank, B. 1999. The Will to Empower: Democratic Citizens and Other Subjects, Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press. [Crossref] , [Google Scholar]: 42) on government as an accretion of ‘small things’ rather than totalizing systems. Karl Polanyi neatly captured the contrast when he argued that the creation of an unfettered market for land and labour in the nineteenth century was a grand utopian scheme – ideologically driven then as it is in its contemporary neo-liberal guise. Yet the array of interventions needed to keep populations alive and productive under market conditions emerged in piecemeal and pragmatic fashion: ‘Laissez-faire was planned’, he argued, ‘planning was not’ (Polanyi 1957 Polanyi , K.

[Google Scholar]). 31. Fairhead and Leach (2003: 151–3) describe the role of donor funds in assembling community forestry in Guinea. 32. I make this argument in the context of Indonesia in Li (2001). 33. The World Bank's new version of the programme has attempted to correct the problem, apparently without success (World Rainforest Movement 2005). 34. The Joint Forest Management programme in India has received massive donor investments, mainly in the form of loan funds from the World Bank (Sundar 2000 Sundar, N. 2000. ‘Unpacking the “joint” in joint forest management’. Development and Change, 31: 255–79. [Crossref], [Web of Science ®] , [Google Scholar]; World Rainforest Movement 2005 World Rainforest Movement ( 2005 ) ‘The great “community forest management” swindle in India: critical evaluation of an ongoing World Bank-financed project in Andhra Pradesh’ , WRM Bulletin 93 . [Google Scholar]). In Francophone West Africa a similar approach, known as ‘gestion des terroires’ (territorial management), has been widely pursued. There have been forty projects covering 2500 villages at a cost of US$280 million in Burkina Faso alone (Batterbury 1998 Batterbury, S. 1998. ‘Local environmental management, land degradation and the “gestion des terroirs” approach in West Africa: policies and pitfalls’. Journal of International Development, 10: 871–98. [Crossref] , [Google Scholar]: 872). 35. An evaluation of the community management programme of Canada's International Development Research Center applauds its provision of well-documented case studies of pilot projects as ‘learning opportunities’ that prove ‘the validity of the concept’ and demonstrate to policy-makers that alternatives to (failed) state management do exist (Gonsalves and Mendoza 2003 Gonsalves , J. and Mendoza , L. ( 2003 ) External Review of IDRC's Community-based Natural Resource Management (CBNRM) Program Initiative (PI) in Asia, Final Report , International Development Research Centre. [Google Scholar]: 4). The authors note that the programme has not yet produced policy shifts or commitments by government agencies to scale up pilot projects, although they expect this ‘pay off’ to occur in future years (Gonsalves and Mendoza 2003: 14, 28, 37, 41). Nowhere do they raise the possibility that existing state management regimes serve vested interests. All that is lacking for improved management is perfected technique, generated in projects and packaged in ‘methods briefs’ and ‘policy briefs’ (see Gonsalves and Mendoza 2003: 24–5, 38). Fairhead and Leach (2003: 48) also note the intrinsic anti-politics of donor-sponsored ‘projects’ that supply resources without threatening entrenched interests. 36. Fairhead and Leach (2003: 150) describe donors’ narration of their role in protecting forest villagers from corrupt state foresters. 37. Ford's work on community management in India was dominated by an ‘exemplary place’ – a village called Sukhomajri in which the model was perfected. The model proved very expensive to create and maintain and could not be replicated in large part because the state bureaucracy saw little to gain from it. The institutional imperatives of the village were studied exhaustively, but those of the state apparatus were overlooked. See Baviskar and Saberwal (2002: 54–9). 38. ‘Reform’ signals the period that began in 1998 with the resignation of Suharto, president for thirty-two years. Decentralization of control over natural resources to hundreds of district governments was a measure introduced by his successor, Habibie, with donor support. 39. Fairhead and Leach (2003: 101–5) describe a corralled consultation process convened by Conservation International that was set up to confirm prior framings, although various sets of participants ‘saw through’ the process leaving it unclear whether ‘consensus and support’ had in fact been produced. 40.

major overhaul to the World Bank's past estimates of global poverty, incorporating new and better data. Extreme poverty-as judged by what \"poverty\" means in the world's poorest countries-is found to be more pervasive than we thought. Yet the data also provide robust evidence of continually declining poverty incidence and depth since the early 1980s. For 2005 we estimate that 1.4 billion people, or one quarter of the population of the developing world, lived below our international line of $1.25 a day in 2005 prices; 25 years earlier there were 1.9 billion poor, or one half of the population. Progress was uneven across regions. The poverty rate in East Asia fell from 80% to under 20 percent over this period. By contrast it stayed at around 50 percent in Sub-Saharan Africa, though with signs of progress since the mid 1990s. Because of lags in survey data availability, these estimates do not yet reflect the sharp rise in food prices since 2005.

analytic framework that can be used to measure and monitor empowerment processes and outcomes. The measuring empowerment framework, rooted in both conceptual discourse and measurement practice, illustrates how to gather data on empowerment and structure its analysis. The framework can be used to measure empowerment at both the intervention level and the country level, as a part of poverty or governance monitoring. The authors first provide a definition of empowerment and then explain how the concept can be reduced to measurable components. Empowerment is defined as a person's capacity to make effective choices—that is, the capacity to transform choices into desired actions and outcomes. The extent or degree to which a person is empowered is influenced by personal agency (the capacity to make purposive choice) and opportunity structure (the institutional context in which choice is made). Asset endowments are used as indicators of agency. These assets may be psychological, informational, organizational, material, social, financial, or human. Opportunity structure is measured by the presence and operation of formal and informal institutions, including the laws, regulatory frameworks, and norms governing behavior. Degrees of empowerment are measured by the existence of choice, the use of choice, and the achievement of choice. Following the conceptual discussion and the presentation of the analytic framework, the authors show how the measuring empowerment framework can be applied using examples from four development interventions. Each example discusses how the framework guided analysis and development of empowerment indicators. They also present a draft module for measuring empowerment at the country level. The module can be used alone or be integrated into country-level poverty or governance monitoring systems that seek to add an empowerment dimension to their analysis. This paper—a product of the Poverty Reduction Group, Poverty Reduction and Economic Management Network—is part of a larger effort in the network to conceptualize, operationalize, and measure empowerment.

Angelsenhttps://doi.org/10.1596/1813-9450-4117SectionsAboutPDF (0.4 MB) ToolsAdd to favoritesDownload CitationsTrack Citations ShareFacebookTwitterLinked In Abstract:This paper presents a framework for analyzing tropical deforestation and reforestation using the von Thunen model as its starting point: land is allocated to the use which yields the highest rent, and the rents of various land uses are determined by location. Forest cover change therefore becomes a question of changes in rent of forest versus non-forest use. While this is a simple and powerful starting point, more intriguing issues arise when this is applied to analyze real cases. An initial shift in the rent of one particular land use generates feedbacks which affect the rent of all land uses. For example, a new technology in extensive agriculture should make this land use more profitable and lead to more forest clearing, but general equilibrium effects (changes in prices and local wages) can modify or even reverse this conclusion. Another issue is how a policy change or a shift in broader market, technological, and institutional forces will affect various land use rents. The paper deals with three such areas: technological progress in agriculture, land tenure regimes, and community forest management. The second part of the paper links the von Thunen framework to the forest transition theory. The forest transition theory describes a sequence over time where a forested region goes through a period of deforestation before the forest cover eventually stabilizes and starts to increase. This sequence can be seen as a systematic pattern of change in the agricultural and forest land rents over time. Increasing agricultural rent leads to high rates of deforestation. The slow-down of deforestation and eventual reforestation is due to lower agricultural rents (the economic development path) and higher forest rent (the forest scarcity path). Various forces leading to these changes are discussed and supported by empirical evidence from different tropical regions.

the context of ecosystem conservation, tropical dry forests have received little or no attention compared with their next-door neighbors, the tropical rainforests. This lack of conservation effort in tropical dry forests is reflected in the fact that few national parks and biological reserves protect and preserve their natural richness, and there are only a handful of real biological research stations with a mandate to bridge the gap between ecology and conservation biology in these ecosystems. The funding and legal framework developed by international institutions and local governments has been implemented mainly to protect mature forest or pristine national parks located in regions other than dry forests. Several complex reasons may explain the lack of protection afforded to tropical dry forests. One of them is rooted in the romanticized vision that the tropics do not exist beyond the Amazon basin, a vision one finds every day in the scientific and nonscientific literature and in the electronic media. Another reason is the high economic value associated with goods and services that can be extracted from tropical dry forests, which contrasts with the relatively small economic value of tropical rainforests. This exploitation is furthered by local and national governments when they use dry forests not as the last frontier but as the first frontier of economic development. In the Caribbean, Mesoamérica, and northern South America, tropical dry forests are located in the most fertile zones for agroindustry and ecotourism development, and they contain a large proportion of the human population. Thus, only a small proportion of their total area is under some level of conservation. In Mesoamérica and in Venezuela, <1% of this ecologically, socially, and economically essential ecosystem is protected. Tropical dry forests are in dire need of integrated and multidisciplinary conservation research projects aimed at expanding traditional species- and niche-based research; increasing the biological and ecological knowledge base; and including human dimensions, which inevitably underlie how ecosystems change over time. Ecological studies on tropical dry forest succession, degradation, and restoration are few and most of them have been generated from a few sites. Tied to these ecological studies, conservation schemes are necessary that emphasize the tropical dry forest's contribution to environmental services and its value as a forest ecosystem, rather than as range or agricultural land. Rather than solely promoting the conservation of forest patches that will form isolated national parks or reserves, conservation approaches that pay landowners for environmental services must be implemented. Integrated land-management plans that complement the efforts of governments and the private sector must be enforced. The payment for ecosystem services carried out by the Costa Rican National Forest Financing Fund (FONAFIFO) is a good example of the feasibility of such initiatives. Furthermore, efforts toward conservation of tropical dry forests must also address the need to consider ecosystem services provided by mature ecosystems and areas at various successional stages within and outside public lands. In fact, secondary dry forests may be the dominant landscape in the forthcoming years, as land abandoned by local farmers recovers. In Costa Rica alone, almost 50% of the Guanacaste Peninsula is covered by deciduous secondary forests. Payment for ecosystem services in the tropics, however, requires funds that are largely unavailable. For a payment strategy to succeed, it is critical that national environmental authorities display the necessary political will to invest resources and develop the required regulatory framework. But it is also fundamental that the governments of developed countries, as well as multinational agencies, international conservation organizations, and private donors, look beyond humid tropical ecosystems and expand their portfolio of conservation investments toward tropical dry forests. We could uncover a wealth of valuable information by consciously promoting land-use practices that minimize the amount of stress and land-cover conversion carried out around dry forested areas. Such an approach, combined with educational programs that promote bioliteracy in local schools and community decision-making organizations, would highlight the economic and ecological value of the tropical dry forest as an ecosystem. This approach would further uncover the contributions of tropical dry forests to society, a role that far surpasses their value for anything else. Such an approach, however, can only be explored and demonstrated by further investigating how to successfully integrate alternative land uses into the management of dry forest ecosystems. With an increasing population, a long history of land-use change, and free-trade agreements that encourage large agroindustry developments (e.g., extensive cattle ranching, and watermelon and sugarcane plantations in Mexico and Costa Rica) and a significant increase of their exploitation for ecotourism, the future of tropical dry forests, at least in the Caribbean, Mesoamérica, and northern South America, is of great concern. Land-use choices that are made around these forests will continue to influence their rapid degradation regardless of how many studies we conduct to find out what it is needed to promote their conservation. The remaining dry forests, which include numerous rare and endemic species, offer a unique opportunity to learn more about types of interactions between species and the resulting ecological processes. This information, in turn, would be of tremendous help to policy makers responsible for defining sustainable development policies aimed at benefiting threatened species (e.g., Scarlet Macaw [Ara macao], Yellow-shouldered Parrot [Amazona barbadensis], jaguar [Panthera onca], Baird's tapir [Tapirus bairdii], great false vampire bat [Vampyrum spectrum)], guayacán [Guaiacum sanctum]). More studies are also needed to understand the ecological succession of disturbed tropical dry forest left in fragments and its contribution as a stepping stone between fragments and the forest. Because small populations or communities may be recovering in regenerating fragments, these areas should not be considered waste land but rather important elements that connect protected areas. Furthermore, the immediate sharing of this ecological knowledge with local communities would help convince them to invest in the longevity of this ecosystem and to promote the recovery of degraded areas. An additional and highly contentious topic is the conflict between increasing human demands on water resources and the varying water needs of the differing components of the tropical forest matrix. The matrix is composed of deciduous tropical forest, mangroves, wetlands, savannas, and riparian forests. Such biological wealth is currently endangered by human water demands that depend on this limited resource. Increasing and uncontrolled use of limited water resources for irrigation, human consumption, and tourism—a phenomenon that translates into new dams, deviation of rivers, and the use of river discharge during low-flow seasons—jeopardizes the future of tropical dry forest biodiversity. We believe that research and conservation in tropical dry forests must generate conservation models that are promoted with the same fervor as those designed for humid forests. For example, phenological aspects (e.g., leaf shed, flowering, fruiting) have been especially neglected in large-scale studies, downplaying the fact that part of the uniqueness of this ecosystem is its phenological responses to changing environmental conditions. These \"preadaptations\" may be essential as global-change-coping mechanisms by tropical biotas. Many questions have yet to be answered. But if we are to understand the phenological responses of individual species and the drivers and effects of degradation and land exploitation on the phenological cycles of the ecosystem at a larger scale—including the organisms that depend on them—more comprehensive conservation efforts are necessary. These efforts must be linked to adequate funding levels that promote comprehensive in situ and comparative studies among dry forest ecosystems across the Americas.","citation":"Arturo Sánchez‐Azofeifa et al.

the applications of noncooperative bargaining theory to water related issues-which fall in the category of formal models of negotiation. They aim to identify the conditions under which agreements are likely to emerge and their characteristics, to support policymakers in devising the \" rules of the game \" that could help obtain a desired result. Despite the fact that allocation of natural resources, especially trans-boundary allocation, has all the characteristics of a negotiation problem, there are not many applications of formal negotiation theory to the issue. Therefore, the authors first discuss the noncooperative bargaining models applied to water allocation problems found in the literature. Key findings include the important role noncooperative negotiations can play in cases where binding agreements cannot be signed; the value added of politically and socially acceptable compromises; and the need for a negotiated model that considers incomplete information over the negotiated resource.

literature has emerged on the definition, measurement, and analysis of poverty. Much of this literature focuses on analyzing poverty at the national level, or spatial disaggregation by general categories of urban or rural areas, with adjustments made for regional price differentials. Yet for an individual city attempting to tackle the problems of urban poverty, this level of aggregation is not sufficient for answering specific questions such as where the poor are located in the city, whether there are differences between poor areas, if access to services varies by subgroup, whether specific programs are reaching the poorest, and how to design effective poverty reduction programs and policies. Answering these questions is critical, particularly for large, sprawling cities with highly diverse populations and growing problems of urban poverty. Understanding urban poverty presents a set of issues distinct from general poverty analysis and thus may require additional tools and techniques. Baker and Schuler summarize the main issues in conducting urban poverty analysis, with a focus on presenting a sample of case studies from urban areas that were implemented by a number of different agencies using a range of analytical approaches for studying urban poverty. Specific conclusions regarding design and analysis, data, timing, cost, and implementation issues are discussed. This paper—a product of the Urban Unit, Transport and Urban Development Department—is part of a larger effort in the department to promote strategies for reducing urban poverty.

Ensuring these people have access to productive work and a better quality of life is the core development challenge of the first half of this century. Growth could itself be jeopardized over the longer term, unless a transformation of society and the management of the environment are addressed integrally with economic growth. Now in its 25th edition, this year's World Development Report examines, over a 50 year period, the relationship between competing policy objectives of reducing poverty, maintaining growth, improving social cohesion, and protecting the environment. The World Development Report 2003 emphasizes that many good policies have been identified but not implemented due to distributional issues and barriers to developing better institutions. The Report reviews institutional innovations that might help overcome these barriers and stresses that ensuring economic growth and improved management of the planet's ecosystem requires a reduction in poverty and inequality at all levels: local, national, and international. As in previous years, the report contains an appendix of selected indicators from the World Development Indicators.

Social tariff schemes of various kinds are already widespread in Latin America, but they suffer from a number of design flaws. Increasing block tariff (IBT) structures are the most prevalent form of social tariffs in the region. These are likely to be more successful in the electricity sector than in the water sector because the correlation between consumption and income is much stronger in the case of electricity than water. Moreover, IBT structures in electricity tend to be much better designed than in the case of water, with lower fixed charges, lower subsistence blocks, and steeper gradients. A number of more sophisticated social tariff schemes are also being applied that combine consumption criteria with some form of socioeconomic screening. These are generally found to perform better than IBTs, although they also present significant room for improvement.

collection of essays on extreme poverty. The first part of the report deals with what it means to live in extreme poverty, how to reach the very poor, through programs, and interventions, and how to make private, and public institutions more responsive to their aspirations. The second part analyzes the relationship between extreme poverty, and human rights. Emphasis is placed on the contribution of the International Movement ATD Fourth World, and its founder Joseph Wresinski, to the understanding of the very poor, and what is needed for\" attacking extreme poverty\".

can capture biodiversity values and provide incentives for conservation, and many integrated conservation and development projects include an ecotourism component. One key assumption behind this strategy is that ecotourism businesses can achieve financial viability. This paper presents a financial case study of the well-known community-based ecotourism lodge 'Casa Matsiguenka', owned by an indigenous Matsigenka population in Manu National Park (Peru), only the second such project to be thoroughly analysed in the literature. Built and financed from 1997 to 2003 with German official aid, the lodge's revenues have only just exceeded operating costs and have not covered the costs of infrastructure replacement, thereby failing to secure long-term business sustainability. Wages and income from handicraft sales have covered about a third of individual cash needs in the two participating communities, but communal income from lodge operating profits (for example to pay for community infrastructure, health care or education) has been minimal. The lodge's difficulties are attributed largely to a flawed business plan in which the lodge has sold its services to its own competitors, a group of ecotourism agencies that have used their lobbying power to create a cartel in Manu. In a narrow analysis, the return on investment for this project has been approximately one-third of what could have been achieved to date by merely investing the start-up grant monies in a bank account and paying the interest directly to the Matsigenka communities in exchange for conservation actions. Broader analysis indicates the modest income and slow pace of business so far has permitted gradual social and economic adaptation on the part of culturally conservative indigenous communities. Moreover, the lodge project has generated processes of social and political organization, and sustained positive contact with Peruvian national society, which can be counted among its successes. The lodge has helped produce dialogue between the Park administration and the Matsigenka communities, a process that could ultimately result in co-management agreements that help to resolve people-park conflicts in the Park.","citation":"Julia Ohl‐Schacherer et al.

paper summarizes the extension of new market mechanisms for environmental services, explains of the importance of generating price information indicative of the cost of mitigating greenhouse gases (GHGs) and presents the rationale and objectives for pilot GHG-trading markets. It also describes the steps being taken to define and launch pilot carbon markets in North America and Europe and reviews the key issues related to incorporating carbon sequestration into an emissions-trading market. There is an emerging consensus to employ market mechanisms to help address the threat of human-induced climate changes. Carbon-trading markets are now in development around the world. A UK market is set to launch in 2002, and the European Commission has called for a 2005 launch of an European Union (EU)-wide market, and a voluntary carbon market is now in formation in North America. These markets represent an initial step in resolving a fundamental problem in defining and implementing appropriate policy actions to address climate change. Policymakers currently suffer from two major information gaps: the economic value of potential damages arising from climate changes are highly uncertain, and there is a lack of reliable information on the cost of mitigating GHGs. These twin gaps significantly reduce the quality of the climate policy debate. The Chicago Climate Exchange, for which the authors serve as lead designers, is intended to provide an organized carbon-trading market involving energy, industry and carbon sequestration in forests and farms. Trading among these diverse sectors will provide price discovery that will help clarify the cost of combating climate change when a wide range of mitigation options is employed. By closing the information gap on mitigation costs, society and policymakers will be far better prepared to identify and implement optimal policies for managing the risks associated with climate change. Establishment of practical experience in providing tradeable credits for carbon-absorbing land-use practices, especially reforestation and conservation management of agricultural soils, will also help demonstrate the viability of a new tool for financing activities that improve water quality, support biodiversity and constitute important elements of long-term sustainability in land-use management.","citation":"Richard L.

Baltic Sea is one of the largest brackish water bodies in the world (Segerstråle 1957) with a number of basins varying from almost fresh water in the northern part of the Bothnian Bay via the more brackish conditions in the southern part to the saline waters of the Kattegat. The Baltic Sea is subject to severe environmental degradation caused by commercial and leisure activities, including fisheries, dredging, tourism, coastal development and land-based pollution sources. This causes severe pressures on vulnerable marine habitats and natural resources, and a tool for aiding marine management is therefore strongly needed. The marine landscape concept presented by Roff &amp;Taylor (2000) is based on the use of available broad-scale geological, physical and hydrographical data to prepare ecologically meaningful maps for areas with little or no biological information. The concept, which was elaborated by Day &amp; Roff (2000) was applied in UK waters (Connor et al. 2006) before it was adopted by the BALANCE project described here. The aim of developing marine landscape maps is to characterise the marine environment of the Baltic Sea region (the Baltic Sea together with the Kattegat) using geophysical and hydrographical parameters. Such maps can be applied, for example, to an assessment of the Baltic-wide network of marine protected areas, and thus provide a sustainable ecosystem-based approach to the protection of the marine environment from human activities, and contribute to the conservation of marine biodiversity. The BALANCE project is based on transnational and cross-sectoral co-operation with participants from nine countries surrounding the Baltic Sea as well as Norway (Fig. 1), and is partially financed by the European Union through the BSR INTERREG IIIB programme.","citation":"Zyad Al‐Hamdani et al.

is prudent to conserve communities which are as species-rich as possible. This is the only means of ensuring that species diversity but also gene diversity is high enough to allow for the necessary adaptations to changed environmental conditions. Arable plant communities are a special case here because losses in the last 5 decades have been particularly severe. Numerous studies from Central Europe reported dramatic declines of the segetal flora.In most of the federal states of Germany, successful measures for protecting the segetal flora, such as the establishment of field flora reserves and field margin strip programmes have often unfortunately come to a halt due to changes in funding, lack of regional support or high levels of bureaucracy. The new project fields for biodiversity, which has been funded by the Deutsche Bundesstiftung Umwelt (DBU) since 2007, aims to establish a network of protected areas for the preservation of endangered segetal species in Germany. Management aimed at preserving and fostering arable wild is to be guaranteed in the long term on at least 100 particularly suitable arable sites.The feasibility study, funded by the DBU during 2007-2008 undertook: 1)Identification of floristically valuable arable sites throughout Germany and their incorporation in a database; 2)Compilation of an overview of field flora reserves/conservation fields still in existence based on a countrywide search; 3)Discussions about funding instruments and the options for implementing protection measures at a regional level with governmental authorities of all the federal states of Germany (excluding Hamburg, Bremen and Berlin); 4)Analysis of several alternative strategies for long-term financing of arable plant conservation.The project fields for biodiversity - establishing a nationwide conservation field network for wild arable plants - is a national endeavour to provide a network of conservation sites as a long-term response to the loss of arable wild which has advanced unabated for decades. As a first milestone in the implementation phase it is aimed at securing 30 sites during the first two years of the project. By the end of the entire funding period there should be a network of at least 100 conservation fields under long-term protection. This is a unique opportunity in the history of the protection of arable wild of creating an urgently needed conservation system with at least medium-term protection for native arable wild plants.","citation":"Stefan Meyer et al.

paper argues that decentralization is a precondition for co-management. However, it is not self-sufficient and there should be an incentive mechanism established through a multilevel decentralization in order for local people to participate. When decentralization at multilevel is applied to co-management for protected areas, its success depends on the participation of all parties based on incentive mechanisms specified. Recent government decentralization in Indonesia is a case in point. Central government has made itself ready for partnership with all levels of governments down to communities by adopting a decentralization policy. However, these opportunities are taken with reluctance by local governments considering the cost they would have to bear, and the decentralization process does not extend beyond the district administration level. We analyze these issues by examining the Barisan I Nature Reserve management in West Sumatra, which straddles four autonomous districts. Different initiatives have been taken by district governments and local communities in protecting this area after the implementation of government decentralization. The study findings support the argument that, if decentralized district governance mechanisms support local communities with additional incentives beyond traditional incentives, concerned stakeholders take an active role in managing their protected areas, thus forming a system of co-management. In addition, the paper proposes an alternative model of co-management. This is based on local incentives and emphasizes that environmental and ecological benefits ensue if a protected area adopts multilevel decentralization down to the village level.

for reducing carbon emissions due to deforestation and degradation (REDD) have garnered considerable global interest and investments. These financial incentives aim to alter the drivers of land use change by reducing opportunity costs of retaining forest cover, and are often promoted as multipartite solutions that not only generate profits and reduce carbon emissions but provide benefits for human development and biodiversity. Currently, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) is debating a post-Kyoto protocol with national or sub-national emission reduction targets. Anticipating the inclusion of REDD in this agreement, &gt;80% of pilot REDD projects are being established in tropical regions (table 1). While the capacity of REDD projects to meet their stated objectives must be assessed post- implementation, land use change models are powerful tools for generating potential outcomes from these pilot initiatives. Table 1. Extent and emissions reductions for all REDD projects as reported by Ecosystem Marketplace, which maintains a comprehensive and up-to-date inventory of REDD projects that are selling credits and/or are verified by a third-party verifier.

This project is conceived by the Provincial Government of Aceh, financed by Merrill Lynch, and co-managed by carbon trading firm Carbon Conservation and NGO Flora and Fauna International. Project managers estimate CO 2 emissions reductions at 3.4 Mt y -1 over 30 years across a 7500 km 2 area (Forest Carbon Portal 2009). From a time-series of Landsat satellite images, Gaveau et al calculate deforestation rates from 1990–2000 and 2000–2006. They apply these annual rates to deforestation probability maps, generated from forest condition in 2006 and six static spatial variables, to predict potential locations of future deforestation through 2030 under three different scenarios: (i) a business-as- usual with no REDD project; (ii) the current 7500 km 2 project; and (iii) an extensive 65 000 km 2 REDD scheme extending across the Aceh and Sumatra Utara provinces. Gaveau et al 's chief contribution is identifying locations where forest carbon projects potentially have the greatest benefits for forest and orangutan conservation. By processing Landsat satellite imagery – now freely available – with relatively few spatial model inputs, this approach also has great potential for widespread application in tropical countries developing historical deforestation baselines. Yet Landsat satellite data also impose limitations for REDD. For example, Gaveau et al are unable to calculate forest degradation, which is highly problematic both to define and detect with Landsat imagery, yet critical especially in Indonesia with extensive logged forests (Curran et al 2004, Ramankutty et al 2007, Asner et al 2006). Nevertheless, Landsat remains one of the most appropriate satellite data products available for countries calculating previous rates of forest change. Assuming that technical roadblocks to REDD are overcome, another challenge surrounds assessing the feasibility of emission reduction scenarios, including those presented by Gaveau et al . Their estimates show that carbon and biodiversity gains would be 6- to 7-fold greater if the pilot project encompassed the 65 000 km 2 northern Sumatra region. Yet, developers chose to implement this REDD project across 7500 km 2 , ~ 10% of Gaveau et al 's expanded scenario region. If REDD programs are to be realized across large spatial scales (e.g., provinces/states), what factors constrain effective implementation? First, high transaction costs and investment risks appear to be major barriers to establishing carbon concessions across large, heterogeneous regions. Identifying who should receive compensation as well as negotiating transparent and effective payment arrangements, is at best challenging especially with ambiguous land use rights and government jurisdiction in Indonesia (Ebeling and Yasué 2008). Protecting fragmented forests from multiple threats of logging, agriculture, and fire is fraught with complexities; who should be held accountable for defending 65 000 km 2 from fire especially during ENSO- associated droughts (Siegert et al 2001, Langner and Siegert 2008)? REDD's effectiveness will require support from people who live in and near REDD projects; Gaveau et al address only biodiversity and forest loss in their paper, but incorporating the potential effects of REDD programs on livelihoods and social dynamics is one of the most critical components of effective assessments via scenario-building and modeling (Soares-Filho et al 2006). Another major obstacle to establishing REDD across large regions is the opportunity costs of carbon concessions. Recent estimates show that profits from protecting aboveground biomass for carbon payments in Indonesian non-peat forests are far below the benefits garnered from converting these forests to plantation agriculture (Butler et al 2009). Yet in order to mitigate forest conversion as proposed by Gaveau et al , carbon must compete with alternative high-value commodities (e.g., palm oil). Although forest carbon credits currently are traded in voluntary markets, carbon prices are considerably higher in compliance markets than in voluntary markets (World Bank 2008). If the UNFCCC generates consensus in December 2009 incorporating REDD in formal market-based trading mechanisms to meet compliance targets, REDD may become a financially competitive land use option even in highly-threatened lowland forests, including those in northern Sumatra. Ultimately, REDD implementation is an iterative process, requiring regular appraisals and improvements at local (i.e., REDD projects) through international (i.e., UNFCCC) levels. The overarching value of REDD pilot initiatives such as this groundbreaking Aceh project and Gaveau et al 's innovative assessments is to identify suitable approaches as well as shortcomings, allowing revised and refined efforts that will mitigate forest degradation via financial mechanisms. The next iteration of REDD program evaluations will also need to incorporate: (i) empirical measurements of carbon stock change attributed to forest degradation; (ii) evaluations of economic incentives for a diverse suite of agents such as local and urban communities as well as the private sector; and, (iii) explicitly consider the fluctuating price of carbon vis-à-vis competing commodity prices.

the last 30 years, human appropriation of global renewable resources has accelerated to the point where 35 per cent of the earth's land surface is now in managed agro-ecosystems, consumptive water use consumes between 50 per cent and 85 per cent of freshwater supply and 60 per cent of ecosystem services are utilised in an unsustainable manner. There are virtually no landscapes in which renewable resources are not already fully allocated among different economic and environmental uses. Furthermore, it is increasingly recognised that water availability issues do not exist in isolation but are linked with the related environmental issues of biodiversity preservation, the carbon cycle, soil degradation, and energy use and supply. It is against this background that the sustainable management of water in mining is increasingly developing a strategic viewpoint where water is viewed as a resource within an interconnected landscape, having economic, environmental and social value and providing a range of environmental services in the provision of public and private goods. This paper explores the issues associated with sustainable management of water in mining from a strategic viewpoint. The cumulative impacts of multiple water users, both within and outside the mining sector, is increasingly threatening the security of supply for all users. To quantitatively assess the ‘true’ value of water it is necessary to: • Better understand the science of ecosystem functioning and how human actions impact on environmental processes. • Develop appropriate policy, finance and governance structures to support innovative programs that preserve ecosystem function and services (including market based instruments). • Apply knowledge as interventions across landscapes in ways that maximise benefits and minimise unintended consequences taking into account differences in the value of water among sectors. A strategic viewpoint of water management relies on knowledge to guide decision making that has been acquired at a range of scales from mine site to mining region. This knowledge must be based on rigorous science, sound data and syntheses of different types of information. Strategic management of water resources will better position the industry in terms of understanding the risks posed by complex, interlinked environmental issues that are increasingly impacting on future access to land and renewable resources, including water, thereby ensuring mining's future social licence to operate.","citation":"D.

conservation biology has become one of the most exciting research disciplines in the life sciences, it has barely begun to wield its potential power in political or high-level policy fora. As a mission-oriented discipline, conservation biology has been applied to a range of resource-management challenges from its inception. But there is a tremendous mismatch between the scale and scope of the problems that conservation science is now informing and those issues of huge significance that we are now uncovering and should be influencing. Changes to global ecosystems are having massive impacts on biodiversity, and these impacts in turn are profoundly affecting human well-being and the planet's life-support systems. If we are to have real influence on the future of biodiversity, then we must bring the findings of our research to bear on decisions that influence the root causes of problems, not just their symptoms. The issue of climate change provides a lesson in how this can be done. Fifteen years ago, as growing evidence suggested that human-caused greenhouse gas emissions were warming Earth's atmosphere, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) was created to assess research on climate change. Having now published three assessments (each consisting of three 800-page volumes) and multiple syntheses and special reports, the IPCC is widely recognized for its invaluable role in bringing the “state of knowledge” concerning climate science to bear on the needs of decision-makers worldwide. Journalists can always find a naysayer to quote, but news articles now typically note what “the IPCC, involving the majority of the world's leading climate scientists,” has concluded. Every 4 years, the IPCC conducts a new assessment geared to meet the needs of decision-makers in the Framework Convention on Climate Change. Similarly, every 4 years another assessment—the Scientific Effects of Ozone Depletion—is released for the use of the signatories to the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer. Both of these assessments are far more than just useful scientific references; they have become “drivers” of policy change. The Kyoto Protocol to limit greenhouse gas emissions would never have been signed had not the IPCC, just prior to the Kyoto negotiations, released its memorable finding that “the balance of evidence suggests that there is a discernable human influence on global climate.” These assessments have not only elevated the significance of climate change at governmental and intergovernmental levels, but through their regular global coverage by the media they have also significantly increased public awareness of the issues of climate change and ozone depletion. So where is the IPCC for Biodiversity or the IPCC for Nitrogen/Phosphorous Cycles? They simply don't exist. This is not to say that we lack high-quality assessments and studies on these topics; examples abound, such as the United Nations Environment Programme's Global Environmental Outlook, the World Resources Institute/United Nations Environment Programme/World Bank/United Nations Development Programme's World Resources series, the World Conservation Monitoring Centre's Global Biodiversity, and the World Wildlife Fund's Living Planet Report. But none of these comes close to the policy influence of the IPCC, and indeed none of them was underpinned by anything like the scientific consensus-building that characterizes the IPCC. A new assessment closely modeled on the IPCC is now underway—the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment ( MA )—that will attempt to fill this gap in the area of ecosystems and biodiversity ( http://www.millenniumassessment.org ). The MA provides members of the Society for Conservation Biology, and the SCB as a society, with a platform that can be used to increase the influence of conservation biology on decision-making at scales from local to global. If the MA proves its utility to decision-makers, it is anticipated that an integrated ecosystem assessment process modeled on the MA will be repeated every 5 to 10 years. What makes a process like the IPCC succeed in bringing cutting-edge science to bear on decision-making? The Harvard Global Environmental Assessment Project concluded that three factors underlie successful global scientific assessments. First, the successful assessment is scientifically credible. The IPCC involves thousands of scientists ( indeed, a very large fraction of the world's leading climate scientists ) as coordinating lead authors, lead authors, contributing authors, chapter review editors, and expert reviewers. All of the IPCC assessment reports undergo two rounds of peer review involving hundreds of reviewers per chapter. The IPCC focuses on what is known with certainty by the scientific community and what remains uncertain. The IPCC is now the gold standard of scientific opinion on the issue, and areas of broad scientific agreement are no longer lost in a fog of disagreements among scientists over minor issues—previously a problem for climate change scientists and certainly an issue now for biodiversity scientists. Second, the assessment is politically legitimate. It is relatively easy for the government of Germany to ignore a report done by experts in Brazil or for a chief executive officer to ignore the findings of a report by a nongovernmental organization. What possible leverage would such a report have, no matter how good the science it contained? Thousands of assessments and studies are published every year. What gives the IPCC more weight with decision-makers than others? Partly it is the authoritative status of the IPCC. But, equally important, the users of the assessment—in this case, national governments—have fully “bought in” to the process. Governments authorized the IPCC and ultimately approve its findings line by line. Scientists from more than 100 countries are involved as authors. Decision-makers cannot ignore the final product because they have been fully involved in its development. Third, the assessment is salient: it responds to decision-makers' needs. This is not to say that scientists do not have an opportunity to introduce new issues and findings that decision-makers need to be aware of; they do. But the priority for the assessment is to inform decisions that are being faced or soon will be faced by decision-makers There has been one previous attempt to create an IPCC for biodiversity: the Global Biodiversity Assessment (GBA), published in 1995. This impressive 1100-page report prepared by leading biodiversity scientists readily meets the criterion of credibility and is still used as a reference by many scientists. It fell far short, however, on the criteria of political legitimacy and saliency. The GBA was intended to serve as an IPCC-like assessment for the Convention on Biodiversity, but the parties to the convention rejected the report before the work even began and in the end refused to receive or use its findings. Partly because the report was prepared in the absence of any consultation with its intended users, it focused more heavily on scientific debates than on debates with policy implications. In addition, the GBA lacked internal consistency and synthesis, which critically limited the likelihood that any of the relevant data and information it contained might become the focus of continuing monitoring or repeated measures. How does the MA rate against these criteria? On the issue of credibility, the assessment will follow procedures for preparation and review almost identical to those used by the IPCC. A team of globally known social and natural scientists jointly chair the scientific working groups, and leading scientists are being invited from around the world as coordinating lead authors and lead authors. An independent peer review board has been established to oversee the review process. In the end, more than 2000 authors and expert reviewers are likely to be involved in the preparation of the MA. Establishing the legitimacy of the process was the major focus of the 4 years of preparation for the launch of the MA. Four international conventions ( biodiversity, desertification, migratory species, and wetlands ) have now authorized the MA as a source of their assessment input. Like the IPCC, all the working groups are jointly chaired by experts in developed and developing countries and will involve a geographically balanced group of authors. The Secretary General of the United Nations has stated that “The Millennium Ecosystem Assessment is an outstanding example of the sort of international scientific and political cooperation that is needed to further the cause of sustainable development.” Saliency is being achieved through consultations with the users and through several iterations of review of the draft assessment outlines by the international conventions and other intended users in the private sector and civil society. In addition, conventions such as the Convention on Biodiversity have made formal requests for specific types of assessment input. The MA focuses on the consequences of changes to ecosystems for human well-being. It pays particular attention to ecosystem “services” and such issues as changes in biodiversity, land cover, and biogeochemical cycles. It will not attempt to duplicate sectoral assessments like the IPCC or forest or agriculture assessments but will focus extensively on integration across these assessments. Too often, scientists provide information on specific sectors when decisions actually will affect multiple sectors. What good is an assessment that tells decision-makers that we can produce enough crops to feed the world 30 years from now if we cannot also tell them the consequences of that increased production for biodiversity, freshwater quality, and coastal fisheries? The MA chose this broad, integrated focus after consultation with its audiences. Therefore, the findings of the assessment will be relevant not only to a minister of the environment but also to decision-makers who typically have far more influence on the fate of ecosystems, including people in the private sector and in ministries of finance, planning and trade. Biodiversity issues are central to all three of the global MA working group reports and to the MA subglobal assessments. Within the Condition Working Group, one chapter will focus on biodiversity and one on biological regulation. These chapters will assess the state of knowledge about numbers of species, their distribution, their historical extinction rates, the current endangerment of species, and the role of biodiversity in ecosystem functioning. Within the Scenarios Working Group, one team is now developing “biodiversity scenarios”: given plausible future changes in the forces driving ecological change, what will be the consequences for rates of species extinction, the resilience of ecological communities and processes, the goods and services produced by ecosystems, and human health? And, within the Responses Working Group, one chapter will be devoted to case-study experiences with efforts to slow the loss of biodiversity. Another chapter will examine the state of knowledge about the development of indicators and approaches to priority setting for ecosystems and biodiversity. Yet another will examine integrated approaches to the maintenance of biodiversity and ecosystem services. Good science does not always result in good decisions. But we will not arrive at good decisions unless authoritative and useful scientific information is presented to decision-makers through a process they cannot ignore. The Millennium Ecosystem Assessment needs to be based on the very best conservation biology. Members of the Society for Conservation Biology, in turn, now have an opportunity to participate in and contribute to a process modeled on the IPCC that can greatly increase the visibility of the findings of conservation biology and their impact on both global and local decision-making.

survey and inventory of tree canopy bio-diversity for cryptogams (myxomycetes, macrofungi, mosses, liverworts, lichens and ferns) in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park resulted in the discovery of an undescribed myxomycete species. This taxon is classified in the order Physarales, family Di-dymiaceae and genus Diachea. A combination of morphological characteristics distinguishes Diachea arboricola H.W. Keller & M. Skrabal sp. nov. from all other species in the genus: peridium iridescent gold to silvery gray; stalk reddish orange above and whitish below, filled with crystals; capillitial threads stiff, dichotomously branched and arising from the tip of the columella; spore ornamentation uniformly covering the entire spore surface, appearing spiny with light microscopy, with scanning electron microscopy as vertical processes with capitate, clustered, spike-like tips. This type of spore ornamentation has not been found in any other Diachea species. Diachea arboricola is known only from the tree canopy, ranging in height from roughly 3 to 21 m, on three tree species, Fraxinus americana, Juniperus virginiana and Quercus alba. Observations of plasmodial growth and fruiting body development are described based on moist chamber cultures. Tree canopy observations in situ suggest that the plasmodium of this species migrates over extensive vertical areas of tree bark. Ecological factors are discussed that include pH of bark substrata. The species description is based on abundant sporangia from 17 different collections. A key to the species of Diachea is provided to aid in the identification of this taxon.KeywordsbiodiversityDiacheaecologyGreat Smoky Mountains National ParkMyxomycetesslime moldtree canopy James Counts, Laura Henley, Damon Lesmeister, Danny Pacholski, Melissa Skrabal and Kenny Snell were student tree climbers from Central Missouri State University who collected samples from the tree canopy.

This paper analyses the political process for handling an outbreak of an insect causing human allergic reactions. In the southern part of the Swedish island Gotland in the Baltic Sea, an outbreak of the northern pine processionary moth, Thaumetopoea pinivora, has occurred. With regard to the human nuisance and long-term effects on the tourist industry, demands have been raised for intervention to reduce and control the insect population. At the same time, there have been warnings against treating the insect population because there are knowledge gaps concerning the wider ecological consequences, including effects on biodiversity. This paper analyses the political process and its problem-solving efforts. Of particular interest is how it dealt with the issue of uncertainty. It was found that the uncertainty associated with the issue hindered the development of a shared understanding of the problem and a possible solution. There seems to be a growing need in society to develop the institutional capacity to handle complex issues that cross different sectors, regulatory frameworks and policy targets.

climate cooperation between industrial and developing countries was first proposed in the early l990s, then under the name of joint implementation (JI). Once in place, this cooperation could lead to a high amount of additional financial flows to developing countries. Nevertheless, many NGOs and developing country representatives were in the beginning very sceptical about JI and feared it would not take into account development priorities and create new kinds of dependence on industrial countries. Therefore, developing countries and industrial countries found a compromise at the Berlin Conference of the Parties as they instituted a pilot phase for so-called activities implemented jointly (AIJ), lasting until 2000. Since the Kyoto conference, this concept has existed in the design of the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM), which allows for industrialised countries to account this kind of activity against their national obligation for greenhouse gas reduction, starting with the year 2000. This paper discusses the first results of the Au pilot phase in Costa Rica, which is important for the evaluation of the whole pilot phase and the ultimate design of the CDM. Costa Rica has a relatively high level of economic and social development and a well-developed environmental policy, which is comparable with that of advanced industrial countries. It is a major destination for ecotourism. Nevertheless, it suffers from high deforestation, owing to unequal distribution of land, migration and cattle ranching, as well as plantation expansion. Moreover, transport emissions are rising rapidly and fossil fuel electricity generation is growing, despite a target of phasing out fossil fuels completely. Building on a broad knowledge base, Costa Rica was able to develop creative environmental policy instruments, such as debt-for-nature swaps and biodiversity prospecting, to attract foreign funding. It is not surprising that it was the first developing country to open an JI office, develop project approval criteria and host AIJ pilot projects. The framework for climate cooperation in Costa Rica can therefore be described as ideal compared with the average developing country. After an initial phase of single bilateral projects, the Costa Rican JI office tried to attract more finance by offering certified tradeable carbon certificates resulting form these projects' offsets. Now it encourages multi-sector large-scale programmes, where transaction costs are lower and coherence with national development objectives can be more easily checked. It directs its attention to public Au investors, such as the Norwegian government. The renewable energy projects suffer from the unrealistic target to phase out fossil fuels by 2001, thus making AIJ projects in this sector impossible from that time. Therefore, the bulk of projects concern forestry, which is prone to uncertainties in the calculation of emission sequestration. A comparison of the estimates shows wildly differing assumptions in baselines and the sequestration capacity of the forests. Whether actual project implementation conforms to the plans remains to be seen. The analysis of the Costa Rican case shows that climate cooperation can be successful in the long run only if the industrial countries offer incentives for investors and if baseline determination rests on a clear set of guidelines. Human and technical capacities are necessary but not sufficient conditions for successful climate cooperation projects in developing countries. They seem to be able to prevent complete project failures, however, and can lead to innovative approaches. The issue will be settled only if large-scale investment is forthcoming under a regime of legally binding emission targets for industrial countries, as stipulated in the Kyoto Protocol. Then the ability to process a huge number of project proposals and to check whether they conform to development priorities, as well as monitoring and verification, becomes crucial.","citation":"Michael Dutschke & Axel Michaelowa (2000)","page":"chunk_2_1"}

order to increase protected area revenue, and as part of a drive for national economic development, the Cambodian government is starting to issue economic concessions in 'sustainable development zones' of of protected areas. The Phnom Aural and Phnom Samkos wildlife sanctuaries cover nearly 600,000 ha and are important for biodiversity conservation and environmental services. They are home to about 30,000 people who rely on subsistence agriculture, cattle raising, and collection of non-timber forest products for their livelihoods. Under the Cardamom Mountains Wildlife Sanctuaries Project, a joint project of the Cambodian Ministry of Environment and Fauna and Flora International, zoning plans have been developed for both sanctuaries through participatory consultation with local stakeholders. But the sanctuaries face threats from clearance of land by in-migrating settlers and the granting of economic concessions. Management of the wildlife sanctuaries is currently heavily dependent on donor finance and there is concern about post project sustainability. Thus there is a need to develop long-term sustainable finance for their management. Part of this challenge is demonstrating the value to Cambodia of continuing to protect the two sanctuaries. This will help to make the case for greater government support to the management of the sanctuaries whether through financial input or through discouraging/preventing economic activities that undermine the effectiveness of protection. This paper reports on a study to provide a set of options for the locally-derived sustainable financing of Phnom Samkos and Phnom Aural. The study has two main components: ecological services valuation - assessing the economic value of the direct and indirect ecosystem services provided by the two sanctuaries, and the potential costs/benefits of allowing continuing land conversion and illegal logging; and protected area financing - assessing the costs of maintaining management activities and recommendations for generating funds.","citation":"Maryanne Grieg‐Gran et al.

total area of woodland in Great Britain (GB) is 2.7 m hectares of which one‐third is State‐owned and two‐thirds private; total annual wood production approximates 12 m cubic meters, while total imports of forest products approximate 48 m cubic meters. Public and government interest in forests and woodlands is significant and growing. However, support for four long‐established forestry educational institutions is diminishing accompanied by a decline in the number of applicants for university and college places in forestry courses (325 in 1996 to 156 in 2003). At the same time, there is an increase in the number of institutions (44 in 2004) offering forestry‐related subjects at postgraduate, undergraduate and technical levels although many of these are minor components within wider courses of anthropology, biology, conservation, development studies, environmental studies, geography and zoology. While these are laudable, there is concern within the forestry profession at the potential decline in education for integrated resource management. Partly to fill this gap, a number of organizations offer short, intensive, professional courses while many industrial companies provide in‐service training. In the UK at least 20 government and non‐government organizations finance over 520 forestry‐related research projects each year. The research is conducted by a large number of government institutions, conservation bodies and universities. The total financial support over the last five years has approximated £ 23 m but the low priority given to forestry in Framework Programme 6 of the EU is likely to lead to a decline in funding unless future EU Framework Programmes recognize the importance of forestry. Recent changes in priorities have resulted in more research on biodiversity, conservation, short rotation coppice and climate change together with wood utilization and overall sustainability.","citation":"Jeffery Burley et al.

of temperate rainforests in Chile has decreased the provision of ecosystem services, including watershed protection, biodiversity conservation, and carbon sequestration. Forest conservation can restore those ecosystem services. Greenhouse gas policies that offer financing for the carbon emissions avoided by preventing deforestation require a projection of future baseline carbon emissions for an area if no forest conservation occurs. For a proposed 570 km{sup 2} conservation area in temperate rainforest around the rural community of Curinanco, Chile, we compared three methods to project future baseline carbon emissions: extrapolation from Landsat observations, Geomod, and Forest Restoration Carbon Analysis (FRCA). Analyses of forest inventory and Landsat remote sensing data show 1986-1999 net deforestation of 1900 ha in the analysis area, proceeding at a rate of 0.0003 y{sup -1}. The gross rate of loss of closed natural forest was 0.042 y{sup -1}. In the period 1986-1999, closed natural forest decreased from 20,000 ha to 11,000 ha, with timber companies clearing natural forest to establish plantations of non-native species. Analyses of previous field measurements of species-specific forest biomass, tree allometry, and the carbon content of vegetation show that the dominant native forest type, broadleaf evergreen (bosque siempreverde), contains 370 {+-} 170 t ha{sup -1} carbon, compared to the carbon density of non-native Pinus radiata plantations of 240 {+-} 60 t ha{sup -1}. The 1986-1999 conversion of closed broadleaf evergreen forest to open broadleaf evergreen forest, Pinus radiata plantations, shrublands, grasslands, urban areas, and bare ground decreased the carbon density from 370 {+-} 170 t ha{sup -1} carbon to an average of 100 t ha{sup -1} (maximum 160 t ha{sup -1}, minimum 50 t ha{sup -1}). Consequently, the conversion released 1.1 million t carbon. These analyses of forest inventory and Landsat remote sensing data provided the data to evaluate the three methods to project future baseline carbon emissions. Extrapolation from Landsat change detection uses the observed rate of change to estimate change in the near future. Geomod is a software program that models the geographic distribution of change using a defined rate of change. FRCA is an integrated spatial analysis of forest inventory, biodiversity, and remote sensing that produces estimates of forest biodiversity and forest carbon density, spatial data layers of future probabilities of reforestation and deforestation, and a projection of future baseline forest carbon sequestration and emissions for an ecologically-defined area of analysis. For the period 1999-2012, extrapolation from Landsat change detection estimated a loss of 5000 ha and 520,000 t carbon from closed natural forest; Geomod modeled a loss of 2500 ha and 250 000 t; FRCA projected a loss of 4700 {+-} 100 ha and 480,000 t (maximum 760,000 t, minimum 220,000 t). Concerning labor time, extrapolation for Landsat required 90 actual days or 120 days normalized to Bachelor degree level wages; Geomod required 240 actual days or 310 normalized days; FRCA required 110 actual days or 170 normalized days. Users experienced difficulties with an MS-DOS version of Geomod before turning to the Idrisi version. For organizations with limited time and financing, extrapolation from Landsat change provides a cost-effective method. Organizations with more time and financing could use FRCA, the only method where that calculates the deforestation rate as a dependent variable rather than assuming a deforestation rate as an independent variable. This research indicates that best practices for the projection of baseline carbon emissions include integration of forest inventory and remote sensing tasks from the beginning of the analysis, definition of an analysis area using ecological characteristics, use of standard and widely used geographic information systems (GIS) software applications, and the use of species-specific allometric equations and wood densities developed for local species.","citation":"Patrick Gonzalez et al.

the biological species concept, the intraspecific variability and true species richness of Palearctic mammals has often been overlooked, and therefore the need to conserve it. Recovery projects of endangered European mammals in Western Europe rely mainly upon translocation of conspecifics from viable populations in Central or Eastern Europe. From a wildlife management and restoration ecology point of view, many such recovery projects have been successful. However, from a biodiversity perspective it could be argued that they could have failed to protect the original European biodiversity. The increasing evidence of a complex phylogeographic pattern in many European mammals - especially in the Mediterranean region - has led to a reconsideration of the conservation unit and highlights the need for species-specific programmes for assuring the survival of threa- tened, distinctive populations. Such programs should also include captive breeding. It is the- refore suggested that a two-level classification of captive breeding programmes is needed according to the degree of threat of concerned taxa, to maximise available resources without jeopardising in situ conservation. It is proposed to distinguish between a) level I captive breeding programmes, which are part of the conservation strategy for seriously threatened taxa and need to be financed by state or federal agencies, and b) prophylactic level II for vulnerable taxa or populations, and for which funds may be available mainly from the pri- vate sector. Available evidence suggests that given adequate husbandry techniques and pre- release training, even captive-bred carnivores can be successfully reintroduced to the wild. However, a closer collaboration among zoological gardens, zoologists and agencies invol- ved in wildlife conservation is needed to avoid ill-conceived, potentially dangerous captive- breeding and re-introduction projects.","citation":"Spartaco Gippoliti (2004)","page":"chunk_2_1"}

The International Finance Corporation (IFC) Safeguard Policies have been the basis for IFC's leadership and approach to environmental and social sustainability. Based largely on the World Bank's operational policies, IFC adopted its current set of Safeguard Policies in 1998 in order to manage environmental and social issues in the private sector business environment in emerging markets. IFC embarked on an ambitious two-year process in FY04 to update all of the Safeguard Policies through a single initiative to develop the next generation of a policy framework based on a clear, concise and comprehensive policy on social and environmental sustainability. Following an intensive review and analysis of the strengths, weaknesses, and gaps in coverage of the current Safeguard Policies, IFC has recast the Safeguards as a Policy and Performance Standards on Social and Environmental Sustainability. The Performance Standards are often considered the defacto standards even in the absence of IFC participation in the project. They could potentially apply to all projects in developing countries. The Performance Standards contain clear and concise requirements geared toward project outcomes and promote performance improvement through monitoring, reporting and feedback. They place new emphasis on implementation through management systems, deal with social and environmental issues in a more integrated manner, and strengthen policy coverage of issues such as pollution, climate change, and biodiversity. In addition, the Performance Standards address a number of additional subjects of direct concern to the private sector such as labor and working conditions and community health and safety. IFC's social and environmental standards are the building blocks for our approach to sustainability and are embodied in IFC's Safeguard policies, Environmental Health and Safety Guidelines, and Disclosure Policy. Together these provide a framework to help our clients manage project risks and improve their performance, and help IFC improve development outcomes and maximize the development impact of our investments.","citation":"Patrick J.

The central question for this paper is whether land managers in Panama might protect or restore forests on their lands in response to the market for the existence value of biodiversity. Conservation financing provided by non-Panamanian sources is used as a proxy for investigating the nature of the market for the existence value of biodiversity. Debt-for-nature swaps and environmental trust funds, such as the Global Environment Facility (GEF), provide examples of demand in this market. This paper examines trends and policies that could change the cost of supplying biodiversity protection and factors that could improve or undermine demand for the existence value of biodiversity. If ecological restoration receives as much support within the conservation community as protection of pristine areas has in the past, then demand in this market is likely to remain strong. The largest challenge for this market will be shifting to the provision of biodiversity conservation by private landowners rather than solely by the national government.","citation":"Steven Wallander (2007)","page":"chunk_2_1"}

The region of Lac Lobeke is situated in the Congo Basin, in southeastern Cameroon. The Baka pygmies and several Bantu-speaking groups have lived here for centuries by agriculture, and hunting, fishing and collecting a great variety of forest products. The degradation and threat to biodiversity started with the arrival of German colonialists at the end of the nineteenth century. The colonisers provided incentives for the commercialisation of ivory, wood and non-timber forest products (NTFP), such as gum and strophantus. In the 1960s, international logging companies acquired concessions for logging, initiating an even more rapid process of environmental degradation and destruction. According to the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF), about 60 percent of the timber exported by Cameroon comes from illegal logging (Usongo June 2000). Additionally, easier access to the deeper forests and better transport conditions led to an increase in poaching of wildlife to such an extent that nowadays the biodiversity of the region is in very great danger. After the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro in 1992 the World Bank created several conservation projects in the Congo Basin that prioritise global preservation in this region, since it represents the second largest area of tropical forest in the world. One of these projects was the `Project for Protection and Management of the Biodiversity of Southeast Cameroon'. This is financed by the Global Environment Facility (GEF), coordinated by the Ministry of Forestry of Cameroon, with technical support from the Deutsche Gesellschaft fur Technische Zusammenarbeit (GTZ) and the WWF. The aims of the project are the establishment of a regional development plan, including the Protected Areas (PAs), community hunting zones and other multiple zones. The WWF is committed to elaborating management plans for two future Protected Areas. One of the concepts envisaged for the management of the PAs is collaborative management. The aim is to involve the local population in decision making, monitoring and benefit sharing, in order to ensure an efficient protection of biodiversity and sustainable local development. In the following paragraphs we describe the relationship of the local population to their habitat. The agriculture, fishing, collecting and income needs in general are focused upon. Then the informal and formal property rights, such as the stakeholders involved in the collaborative management, are analysed. Finally, we discuss the potentials and constraints of a collaborative approach for the management of the National Park Lac Lobeke. (1) The Concept of Co-management Defining collaborative management Collaborative management--or, in short, co-management--consists, according to Townsend and Pooley (1995), of any set of institutional arrangements between relevant stakeholders that structure an external relationship for resource governance. As such, it has to be distinguished from an internal structure which is, for instance, found in a `pure' common property regime. Borrini-Feyerabend (1996: 17) has pointed out that collaborative management is not a tightly defined concept and that the term is used for a variety of institutional arrangements, ranging between mere consultation and the transfer of decision-making authority. Borrini-Feyerabend et al. (2000) define co-management as a situation in which two or more social actors negotiate, define and guarantee amongst themselves a fair sharing of the management functions, entitlements and responsibilities for a given territory, area or set of natural resources. The social actors, or stakeholders, primarily include the agency in charge (usually a state agency) and various associations of local residents and resource users. However, co-management can also involve non-governmental organisations, local administrations, traditional authorities, research institutions, business and others.

number of recent publications have pointed out the accelerating speed at which ecosystems and biodiversity are being lost (United Nations Development Programme/United Nations Environment Programme/The World Bank/The World Resources Institute 2000). The general view is that conservation can only be achieved in a global network of protected areas (see Pimm et al . 2001). To safeguard the most important ecosystems, Myers et al . (2000) have suggested that we primarily conserve 25 biodiversity hotspots, in particular forests, comprising 1.4% of the land surface of the Earth. The costs for the conservation of these hotspots have been estimated at US$ 500 million per year ( Myers et al . 2000), while the costs of a global network of protected areas may even reach US$ 27.5 billion per year (James et al . 1999). Even though these costs may seem minor compared to, for example, the costs of global armament, governments in developing countries and environmental organizations are clearly not in the position to finance conservation. It is thus urgent to raise additional funds to safeguard biodiversity. In the following, I suggest a twofold strategy, based on tourism.","citation":"Stefan Gössling (2002)","page":"chunk_2_1"}

The distribution of predatory soil nematodes (Mononchida) across Europe is well described. However, in Ireland knowledge of mononchids is limited to a single study. The CréBeo project was the first systematic survey of soil biodiversity in the major land-use types across the Republic of Ireland. Nematodes were sampled from 61 locations with an extensive geographical spread including arable, pasture, broadleaf forest, coniferous plantation, rough grazing and peatland sites. This study resulted in 11 first records of mononchid species from Ireland (of which 2 are new records for Britain and Ireland). We discuss the mononchid species found and aspects of their distribution across major land uses.

decision model for the efficient management of a conservation fund over time.— An important task of conservation biology is to assist policy makers in the design of ecologically effective conservation strategies and instruments. Various decision rules and guidelines originate, e.g., from the Theory of Island Biography (MacArthur &amp; Wilson, 1967) and metapopulation theory (Hanski, 1999). Designing effective strategies and instruments, however, is only part of the solution to problems of biodiversity conservation. In the real world, financial resources are scarce, and it is not only important that policies are ecologically effective but also that they are economically efficient, i.e. lead to maximum ecological benefit for a given resource input. Efficiency has been analysed, e.g. in the context of the spatial allocation of conservation funds (Wu &amp; Bogess, 1999) and of the spatial design of compensation payments for biodiversity enhancing land–use measures (Wätzold &amp; Drechsler, 2002). Decision analysis is a helpful tool for integrating knowledge from different disciplines and identifying optimal strategies and policies (e.g., Drechsler &amp; Burgman, 2003). Methods of decision analysis, such as optimisation procedures, are often a core component of ecological–economic models that bring together ecological and economic knowledge via formal models (e.g., Ando et al., 1998, Drechsler &amp; Wätzold, 2001, Johst et al., 2002). Such models do not only allow a static integration of economic and ecological aspects but also to describe the dynamics of ecological and economic systems in an integrated manner (Perrings, 2002). Examples of such dynamic modelling approaches are Richards et al. (1999), Costello &amp; Polasky (2003) and Shogren et al. (2003). In the present paper we investigate a dynamic conservation management problem different from those of the above mentioned authors and tackle the problem of long–term conservation when future financial budgets are uncertain. The background for this problem is that many species can only survive if certain types of biodiversity–enhancing land–use measures are carried out on a regular basis, such as regularly mowing meadows to create habitat for butterflies (Settele &amp; Henle, 2002). This means that funds have to be regularly available over time, because a temporal gap in the availability of funds may irrevocably drive a species to extinction. While over the last two decades or so a growing commitment of society and governments to conserve biodiversity could be observed, that in many cases also included the increasing provision of funds for this purpose, there are signs that this commitment is currently weakening. An example of such signs are opinion polls in some countries (e.g. Germany) showing that environmental and resource protection issues are given a lower priority by the general public than ten years ago. This implies that there is an increasing risk that conservation funds will be lower in the future than today either through a decrease in political support for such funds or through a decline in donations for private organisations that finance conservation funds....","citation":"Martin Drechsler & Frank Wätzold (2004)","page":"chunk_2_1"}

order to obtain mining land reclamation scheme reasonably, the matter element model was proposed. The divergence which is the character of matter element model was used to design land reclamation schemes. The of land reclamation matter element model are nature state, geology structure, reclamation process, mining subsidence state, present mining condition financing. At first, the author applied the divergence of matter element to establish scheme collection. Then qualified schemes are selected preliminarily according to the known value. The following step is establishing another appraisal matter element model, which eigenvalues are land production, cost, farmer per enhancive income, ecosystem stability, biodiversity, landscape diversity. In the appraisal matter element, Shannon index reflects biodiversity and affinity analysis reflects landscape diversity. Through the appraisal matter element model dependent function between preliminarily schemes was set up. Finally, the most excellent one is selected by the optimal appraisal method. Moreover, a design process of land reclamation in Neiqiu mining subsidence was introduced. The result shows that the divergence tree method is extension and logical.","citation":"Yanbin Wu et al.

to current notions about water abundance in Lebanon, the country is facing serious problems of unavailability, both in quantity and quality, geographical and sectoral. Even though this is due to several existing human-related aspects, i.e. management, ill-finance, non-integration and lack of relevant awareness on water use, the new dimension of climate change is unfortunately adding to the water problems in the country. Databases in Lebanon are not quite consistent and accurate, implying difficulty in interpreting correctly trends of change. Water supplies vary in the country from typically mild wet Mediterranean at the coast (600-800m.m.), through oromediterranean at the mountains (800-1200m.m.), to semi-arid inland (200 + 400m.m.). But actual records on the supply, i.e. precipitation, reflect a decreasing pattern over the last century. This is in agreement with predicted trends of temperature and precipitation values obtained from the GCM models over Lebanon. The HadCM2/HHGGax model predicts an average of 1.6 deg.C increase in temperature by the year 2020, and an equivalent average of about 3 percent less precipitation. Water balance is overall still positive, but deficits are commonly felt locally. The projection in ten to fifteen years, however, predicts an annual deficit of up to 800m.c.m. with the business as usual. The expected resultant impacts of climate change on resources, natural settings and human settings are directly related to water. The former includes, in addition to water itself, forestry, biodiversity and fisheries. In the latter two are incorporated inland and coastal zones as well as all the productive sectors. Cross impact structural analysis can reveal which socio-economic variables are most influenced, and then a driving power/dependency chart can reveal four types of strong or weak drivers, or otherwise. In view of the above, adaptation measures are given at strategic, population and individual levels with different opportunities from short to medium to long-term phases.","citation":"Mohamad Khawlie (2001)","page":"chunk_2_1"}

The author goes on to develop an original analytical treatment of the incremental cost financing mechanisms adopted by the Convention on Biological Diversity. Significantly, he undertakes a microeconomic study of land use change in a biosphere reserve in South-East Mexico. Based on an original data set, the author presents a detailed modelling exercise of resource and land use choices at the individual farm level with related projections of the impact at both community and regional levels. Techniques used include multi-period linear programming and dynamic stock-flow simulation. The book concludes by addressing policy implications and options for future research.","citation":"Raffaello Cervigni (2001)","page":"chunk_2_1"}

for environmental services (PES) is a promising mechanism for conservation. It also has the potential to contribute to social objectives such as poverty reduction. To promote synergy in the implementation of PES, however, a number of conditions on spatial, economic, ecological, and institutional feasibilities are essential. This study discusses factors affecting the synergy prospect of PES and provides a simple framework for assessing the potential for synergy in the implementation of PES, focusing on spatial correlation of thematic areas and funding availability for payments. We apply the framework to an empirical analysis of the “water funding” in Costa Rica, a new conservation financing source generated by water tariff revenue and will be channeled through the existing national PES program of Costa Rica (Pago por Servicios Ambientales, PSA). The analysis can help guide the re-allocation of the regular PSA budget in response to the water funding for synergy among conservation goals (watershed and biodiversity) and social development objective.","citation":"Wei Zhang & Stefano Pagiola (2009)","page":"chunk_2_1"}

second pillar of the CAP is expected to play a key role for rural development – especially for less favoured areas. Conservation of biodiversity and the cultural landscape and the competitiveness of farmers are important objectives addressed by different measures. The importance of the second pillar has been heavily emphasised for all the different objectives. The aim of the present paper is to analyse the programs of the second pillar for the federal state of Hesse, Germany. To give an overview of the programs the design of the measures is illustrated in detail. The programs are assessed from a theoretical point of view. Furthermore, the programs are classified into three axes in regard to the main objectives. The findings are threefold. Firstly, the Hessian rural development plan is very diverse in terms of program design, objectives and co-financing. Secondly, the assessment of second pillar programs lacks a detailed analysis considering effects and costs and comparing alternative measures. Thirdly, in Hesse the largest emphasis by financial means is applied to environmental and land management issues, namely the agri-environmental program.","citation":"Rüdiger Elsholz (2008)","page":"chunk_2_1"}

value biodiversity found in tropical rain forests for a variety of utilitarian, aesthetic, moral, ecological, and socioeconomic reasons (Botkin and Talbot, 1992). For instance, traditional medicines derived from plant and animal species found in the tropics provide health services to rural and urban populations; about 25 percent of the pharmaceutical products produced in the United States are associated with plants (WRI et al., 1992). Genetic materials extracted from plant and animal species have contributed to the development of commercial agricultural products (e.g., new varieties of wheat, maize, and rice) that are more resistant to pests and diseases. And nature tourism, often associated with protected wildlife habitats, has become an important source of income, generating about $ 12 billion annually in worldwide earnings (Lindberg, 1991). There are important socioeconomic and political considerations in the valuation of biological resources and the protection of biodiversity. First, the benefits that result from biodiversity have spatial and temporal dimensions. The ecological services linked with biodiversity, such as clean air and water, and the use of genetic material and ingredients extracted from plants, animals, and microorganisms, occur at different places and at different times, often beyond the “economic time scale” of individuals. Second, biodiversity has characteristics of a public good locally arid nationally and may be considered a “global environmental good” in an international context. The benefits of public goods flow to all people regardless of whether they have paid for the good, which means that public goods suffer from the problem of “free riders.” In a national context, economists have long focused attention on the difficulty of financing public goods and have generally concluded that such goods will be underprovided by markets. In the international context, the provision and financing of public goods is even more problematic. These characteristics make management of biodiversity institutionally complex and create problems in defining property rights. Third, conservation of biodiversity can create significant nonuse values. By its very existence, biodiversity can generate economic value without requiring actual use and can provide value by leaving open the option of future use.","citation":"Randall A.

is one important reason for the impressive growth of pharmaceutical, chemical and agro-industry in this century. \"Patents\" from nature and the ethnological knowledge linked to their use in day-to-day life have inspired generations of inventors to create a vast array of products ranging from Aspirin to Bacillus thuringensis and Phosphinothricin to Zocor, some of which generate annual sales of more than US$ 1 billion. Biodiversity's genetic potential for biotechnology might be even greater, and products like tissue plasminogen activator from vampire bats, or high-laurate canola oil from rape seed transformed with a gene from an undomesticated Californian bay will soon be available on the market. Some of these new products might pose a threat to biodiversity or to the economies of tropical and subtropical countries, as in the case of Calgene's high-laurate canola oil which can substitute coconut and palm kernel oil. The research agreement between INBio and Merck, Sharp & Dohme acknowledges that biodiversity can be used for product development in a sustainable manner and thus conserved for future generations. Royalty obligations on net sales of future pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, fragrances and biotech products to finance conservation measures comprise only a minor fraction of potential benefits which might contribute to maintaining biological diversity and variability. Even more important are the contributions that capacity building and technology transfer can make to the scientific and technological development of biodiversity-rich countries. Fair research partnerships between source countries and industry and academic institutions in industrialised countries are necessary. National scientists must spend more time investigating biodiversity, both at the basic research level and in the development of new products. The use of biological diversity for socioeconomic development is an important goal for Costa Rica, and INBio is making a significant contribution to this process.","citation":"Werner Nader & Nicolas Mateo (2001)","page":"chunk_2_1"}

many countries, lack of awareness, capacity and technology availability are among the strongest constraints to maintain or enhance biodiversity levels. From the activities being developed under the Climate Change convention we can observe that the introduction of a market mechanism accelerates the process of Capacity Building and Technology Transfer through greater bottom-up demand and more top-down funding. A similar market mechanism for Biodiversity could greatly increase finance streams to projects and to Capacity Building and Technology Transfer. However, despite several early attempts to market biodiversity in one form or other, it is clear that a real market mechanism does not yet exist. There are some serious constraints to its development, among which the lack of international legal frameworks, product definition and property rights are but a few, and it will take much time and effort to overcome these. In the meantime, there is a synergy between Climate Change and Biodiversity markets that deserves to be developed further. Many Climate Change mitigation activities, particularly in the forestry sector, show additional biodiversity benefits, and in some cases buyers of forestry ‘carbon credits’ may be prepared to pay extra for this added value. This interrelationship provides the opportunity to let the existing Climate Change market function as a booster for Biodiversity Capacity Building and Technology Transfer. In this paper two case studies are presented that exemplift this. One is the technology transfer of Reduced Impact Logging methodologies to SE-Asian logging companies, in the early years of the Climate Change negotiations (forest management is no longer eligible under the Kyoto Protocol’s CDM). The other is a recent project in Colombia that seeks to sell ‘environmental shares’ in combination with carbon credits.","citation":"J. Fehse (2003)","page":"chunk_2_1"}

thesis is concerned with the accountability of public international financial institutions to their constituencies at global and local geographic scales. It investigates the compliance of the World Bank and the Global Environment Facility (GEF) with their own environmental and social policies as they relate to biodiversity protection. While the World Bank and the GEF pursue a global environmental agenda, their environmental and social policies commit the institutions to building bridges between the global and the local levels by requiring the participation of locally affected communities in decision-making. The study investigates the compliance with the policies in a specific geographic, political and economic space. Cameroon was chosen because both institutions consider the country's biodiversity to be of global significance and are financing operations which have indirect and direct impacts on its biodiversity. The operations investigated include World Bank macro-economic policy advice and traditional investments in infrastructure projects as well as a GEF project specifically designed to protect biodiversity. The central finding of this research is that the institutions comply only partially and in an uneven manner with their own mandatory policy guidelines. In order to mitigate the risk of studying the institutions' operations in only one country and to ascertain possible systemic patterns of institutional behaviour, the results of the case studies are contrasted with the institutions internal evaluation reports covering their overall portfolios. A political ecology approach to international financial institutions is used to examine the political factors behind the emergence of the institutions' biodiversity agenda and the implementation of their operational policies. Analytical tools from both political science and the areas of sociology and economics concerned with theory of organization are employed to further the understanding of the functioning of the global institutions. Finally, the thesis seeks to contribute to defining the characteristics of global institutions which can mediate between the global and local levels by creating spaces of negotiation in which a plurality of views are taken into account.","citation":"Korinna Horta (2000)","page":"chunk_2_1"}

of life and living systems are a necessary condition for human development. As human use of resources, energy, and space intensified over the past few centuries, the diversity of life has been substantially diminished in most parts of the world. Conserving and restoring important components of the earth's biodiversity is our obligation to future generations. Biodiversity conservation is currently a principal goal for resource management of 11.5% of the world's surface area. However, substantial portions of non-human life occur outside of legally protected spaces. Even those that occur within reserves either move or have remnant populations outside. Maintaining connectivity between habitats, populations, and gene pools in and outside parks and reserves is vital for successful biodiversity conservation and restoration. Ecologists have proposed biological corridors, biosphere reserves, ecosystem management, and ecoregional planning as approaches to integrate biodiversity conservation and socioeconomic development at increasingly larger spatial scales. Ecosystem, species, and genetic level integrators appropriate to specific ecological, economic, political, social, and cultural contexts need to be identified, described, and tested in development planning and management. Globally, ecosystem services have gained attention as an integrator of biodiversity use and conservation that is amenable to economic valuation and could provide a basis for negotiations between conservation and development stakeholders. However, as the results of the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment showed, human societies tend to favor ecosystem services with a production bias, to the detriment of all others; three of the four services that have improved during the past 50 years are crop, livestock, and aquaculture production. The fourth service, enhanced carbon sequestration, has kindled hopes for linking emerging incentives in carbon markets and financing to biodiversity conservation and recovery. Critics claim that forest recovery leading to increased carbon sequestration has been confined to rich nations, and was possible only because the forests were previously exploited for production purposes. Climate change constraints and carbon-financing opportunities have emerged only in the past two or three decades. Voluntary initiatives in the financial sector to link land use, land-use change, and forestry with carbon sequestration and conservation, and recovery of biodiversity, must be seen as opportunities for using the best available ecological and other expert knowledge to improve the chances for biodiversity futures. Ecosystem services may also provide indirect ways to sustain species and genetic-level linkages between biodiversity in and around protected areas. Globally, humans are moving to the cities. The ethical and aesthetic implications of these human migrations are uncertain and open to debate. But abandoned lands in and around protected areas may be managed as wildlife habitats mixed with productive activities such as forestry, animal husbandry, and agriculture. Case studies and context-specific evidence of successful integration of biodiversity conservation at various levels and socioeconomic development at a range of spatial scales are urgently needed. Wide-ranging charismatic species almost always have spatial requirements that extend beyond parks and sanctuaries. They provide incentives and opportunities for planning and managing biodiversity at regional scales. In Sichuan, southwest China, forestry activities have been abandoned and provincial level plans to conserve and restore giant panda habitats are gaining acceptance among development planners. In 2002, following the Johannesburg Summit on Sustainable Development, UNEP and UNESCO launched the Great Apes Survival Project as a response to global concerns over the future of bonobos, chimpanzees, gorillas, and orangutans. The range of bonobos, for example, is restricted to selected parts of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, including forests lying outside legally protected areas. These initiatives will tell us whether it is possible to successfully integrate conservation and development practices. The other three great ape species, as well as many other species with large parts of their range outside protected areas, provide similar challenges and opportunities. Revival of commitments to conserve iconic species and populations, possibilities for influencing land-use change and forestry by linking ecosystem services and carbon financing, and compatibility between tourism and other productive sectors are opening up an era of options for integrating use and conservation of biodiversity. If these opportunities are to benefit both biodiversity and human society, ecologists must find new and constructive ways of working with development planners and decision makers. The Man and the Biosphere and other UNESCO programs for international cooperation are global platforms for trying out new ways of bringing conservation and development together.

document presents the proceedings of a one-day Workshop on Investing in Biodiversity Conservation held at the Inter-American Development Bank in Washington, D.C., on October 28, 1996. The first part of the workshop was dedicated to the presentation of key topics on biodiversity financing by five leaders in the field. The second part of the workshop was dedicated to a discussion and exchange of ideas on the role of the IDB in investing in biodiversity conservation. Three main recommendations emerged: 1) The Bank should prepare a report on on its experience in biodiversity projects and development programs with biodiversity components; 2) A task force should be formed to work on a bio-diversity policy or strategy; 3) IDB staff should be trained to understand the biodiversity concept and its implications in project preparation and implementation.","citation":"Jeffrey A.
