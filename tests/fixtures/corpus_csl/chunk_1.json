At the heart of this challenge lies the low financial and political value which is often assigned to biodiversity and the resulting lack of financial mechanisms for conservation and sustainable use. This report provides an overview of existing and experimental financing mechanisms that can be used to encourage the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity. To help to better understand these mechanisms, it proposes a taxonomy that divides the mechanisms into three categories: 1) Those that protect biodiversity as a public good; 2) Those that require correcting so-called \"negat","language":"en","keyword":"Biodiversity; Biodiversity conservation; Business; Environmental resource management; Environmental science; Ecology; Biology","note":"OA:TRUE; OA_status:bronze; Citations:20"},{"type":"article-journal","id":"https://openalex.org/W4235089722","title":"Biodiversity Finance","author":[{"given":"","family":"Michael C.

PES could either provide additional funding for protected areas, pay land users to conserve biodiversity outside protected areas, or both. PES require a secure long-term source of financing to work effectively. Obtaining payments directly for biodiversity conservation is difficult, however. In most cases, water users are the most likely source, either directly or indirectly. Thus the potential for PES to help conserve biodiversity depends, in a large measure, on the degree to which areas of interest for conservation of water services overlap with areas of interest for conservation of biodiversity.","language":"en","keyword":"Biodiversity; Payment; Ecosystem services; Biodiversity conservation; Quarter (Canadian coin); Measurement of biodiversity; Watershed; Natural resource economics; Business; Environmental resource management; Work (physics); Geography; Environmental planning; Ecology; Environmental science; Economics; Ecosystem; Finance; Biology; Mechanical engineering; Archaeology; Machine learning; Computer science; Engineering","note":"OA:FALSE; OA_status:closed; Citations:22"},{"type":"article-journal","id":"https://openalex.org/W336525366","title":"International Conservation Finance: Using Debt Swaps and Trust Funds to Foster Conservation of Biodiversity","author":[{"given":"","family":"Steven M.

Beginning in the 1950s and especially in the 1960s, a looming global food crisis led to the development of a group of international agricultural research centers with a specific mandate to foster international exchange and crop improvement relevant to many countries. This formalization of a global biological commons in genetic resources was implemented through an elaborate system of international nurseries with a breeding hub, free sharing of germplasm, collaboration in information collection, the development of human resources, and an international collaborativ","language":"en","keyword":"Intellectual property; Mandate; Agriculture; Business; Sustainability; Poverty; Global commons; Excellence; Economic growth; International trade; Political science; Economics; Geography; Law; Ecology; Archaeology; Biology","note":"OA:TRUE; OA_status:gold; Citations:64"},{"type":"book","id":"https://openalex.org/W1954383359","title":"Nature Tourism, Conservation, and Development in KwaZulu Natal, South Africa","author":[{"given":"","family":"Bruce Aylward"},{"given":"","family":"E.

As a mission-oriented discipline, conservation biology has been applied to a range of resource-management challenges from its inception. But there is a tremendous mismatch between the scale and scope of the problems that conservation science is now informing and those issues of huge significance that we are now uncovering and should be influencing. Changes to global ecosystems are having massive impacts on biodiversity, and these impacts in turn are profoundly affecting human well-being and the pl","language":"en","keyword":"Conservation biology; Conservation science; Nature Conservation; Geography; Environmental planning; Environmental resource management; Biology; Ecology; Environmental science; Biodiversity","note":"OA:FALSE; OA_status:closed; Citations:16"},{"type":"article-journal","id":"https://openalex.org/W1980631102","title":"Greenhouse–gas–trading markets","author":[{"given":"","family":"Richard L.

Conservation financing provided by non-Panamanian sources is used as a proxy for investigating the nature of the market for the existence value of biodiversity. Debt-for-nature swaps and environmental trust funds, such as the Global Environment Facility (GEF), provide examples of demand in this market. This paper examines trends and policies that could change the cost of supplying biodiversity protection and factors that could improve or undermine demand for the existence value of biodiversity.
