Notably, interest in the increased use of incentive systems and market-like instruments continues to expand.

It is difficult to increase crop productivity with the current availability of land, water resources, labour, finance and crop production technology. Among the newer technologies, the cultivation of genetically modified crops (GMCs) may help in improving food availability, nutritional quality and shelf life of harvested produce and in developing plants resistant to insect pests, disease pathogens and herbicides. However, GMCs have attracted many critics because of their potential impacts on biodiversity, toxicity to non-target organisms, cross-resistance in pests, the higher prices of seed","language":"en","keyword":"Business; Productivity; Biotechnology; Natural resource economics; Food security; Monopoly; Crop; Agricultural economics; Population; Resistance (ecology); Agriculture; Economics; Biology; Economic growth; Agronomy; Market economy; Environmental health; Ecology; Medicine","note":"OA:FALSE; OA_status:closed; Citations:1"},{"type":"article-journal","id":"https://openalex.org/W2142879389","title":"Establishment of a community managed marine reserve in the Bay of Ranobe, southwest Madagascar","author":[{"given":"","family":"RD Stein - Rostaing"},{"given":"","family":"EMS Belle"},{"given":"","family":"GW Stewart"},{"given":"","family":"B De Ridder"},{"given":"","family":"R J-L Komeno"},{"given":"","family":"Frédéric Ramahatratra"},{"given":"","family":"B Remy - Zephir"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[]},"container-title":"Madagascar Conservation & Development","volume":"4","issue":"1","DOI":"10.4314/mcd.v4i1.44010","URL":"https://www.ajol.info/index.php/mcd/article/download/44010/27525","abstract":"The Bay of Ranobe, in southwest Madagascar, once noted for its high biodiversity and fish abundance, is under increasing pressure from overfishing, pollution, sedimentation and tourism.
