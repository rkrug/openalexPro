    devising a physical marginality index for olive cultivation based on
    soil quality and slope, we estimate an approximate area of 200,000
    hectares of marginal olive plantations in Andalusia. The risk of
    abandonment of these farmlands increases with the decoupling of the
    CAP subsidies and with the socio-economic characteristics of the
    production. The probable abandonment of these areas implies the
    negative consequences of wild forestation. We present some actions
