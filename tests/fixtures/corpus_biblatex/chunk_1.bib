    species-rich as possible. This is the only means of ensuring that
    species diversity but also gene diversity is high enough to allow
    for the necessary adaptations to changed environmental conditions.
    Arable plant communities are a special case here because losses in
    the last 5 decades have been particularly severe. Numerous studies
    from Central Europe reported dramatic declines of the segetal
    flora.In most of the federal states of Germany, successful measures
