    overused in Albania. Summer pastures are usually located a few
    kilometres from the village, while winter pastures are found very

    hot, dry summers, why farmers have traditionally moved their animals
    during this season. They have moved them to winter pastures in the

    have declined since democratization in the early 1990s. This paper
